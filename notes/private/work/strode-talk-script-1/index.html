At Embecosm we work on the boundary of hardware, more specifically with
compilers. Compiler are programs that translate one computer language into
another, I&rsquo;m not going to go in detail about it but for the computing students
it basically translates from a high level language, like C, Python or Rust, to
a low level language, like assembly. My work involves a lot of
coding &ndash; so a lot of problem solving, time management and constant learning as
things get upgraded, documentation changes and just new skills you have to pick
up for different projects.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know a thing about compilers when I first applied. That was never an
issue though. So</p><a href=#how-did-i-get-here><h2 id=how-did-i-get-here><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How did I get here?</h2></a><p>I moved from Brazil in 2017 and ended up being put in a Level 2 BTEC in ICT (Information
and Creative Technology) given my interest in studying Computer Science at Uni.</p><p>After that, I did a BTEC Level 3 in IT which was again
recommended to me as an aspiring Computer Science student.</p><p>Besides online courses that I took out of my own interest, those two courses
were the first formal training that I had in any sort of computing.</p><p>IT was not what I really wanted to do, but my college didn&rsquo;t have any sort of
Computer Science BTEC&rsquo;s so I had to get through it and just study things that
really interest me on my spare time.</p><p>///me as someone that already knows what they want to study. BTEC&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t always
the best option, in my specific situation A level Maths is an entry requirement
for every Uni I wanted to go. And taking A level Maths just wasn&rsquo;t possible
with my timetable, so I ended up not meeting the requirements. So the message
here is please check your requirements and please question what people think is</p><p>I ended up finding Embecosm when I had to apply for my work experience week.
They were in the college&rsquo;s database as a company that
normally does take students from my college. It was only one the places
I applied, I basically applied to anything computer related as I was very keen
in getting some experience in the real world &ndash; because even if I didn&rsquo;t enjoy
the placement I would at least know what I don&rsquo;t enjoy doing.</p><p>I emailed Embecosm towardss the end of October 2018 asking if there were any vacancies
available for
work experience in March. I was told that Embecosm already agreed to take one
work experience student, and would only consider a second one if they have
a particular passion for the field.</p><p>Thankfully, I was offered to go there and talk to Jeremy. I was extremely
nervous about going as I really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect and was very scared
that I was biting more than I could chew. So I went for the interview and was
just very honest with Jeremy. I told him that I was still learning the basics,
that I didn&rsquo;t really have any projects to show him beside assingments and simple
programs that I wrote to help me apply what we were learning at college.
However, I told him that I&rsquo;m very keen to self study anything that would be
helpful for the placement - something that I was kind of used to do as my
course didn&rsquo;t really have much of a focus on computing oriented subjects as it was an IT
course.</p><p>I also told him that I was (and well, am) very interested in AI (Artificial
Inteligence), which I guess showed him my interest and engagement with the
computing field. I walked out of Embecosm with my work placement guaranteed
(yay). But, more than that, Jeremy offered me to work there part-time so
I could gain knowledge and experience leading to the work experience week,
something that I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting and was just so awesome. Yes, I did
get paid for all of it.</p><a href=#how-did-it-go><h2 id=how-did-it-go><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How did it go?</h2></a><p>So as I said, I really didn&rsquo;t have much experience. I was extremely excited
though, it is not every day that you get an opportunity like that. I asked my
supervisor for material to study, which gave some pointers on what skills
I needed to focus on. From there I just worked on those skills using a lot of
Google. There is a surprinsingly big amount of content on learning computer
science from home, there are recorded lectures, free courses and even just full
curriculums for you to follow.</p><p>My work experience project, was together with my supervisor, to implement an AI filtering
system on a board for a real Embecosm client. Very cool. Again to my surprise,
I was offered to fly to Sillicon Valley to work on it as the client was based
there. Very unexpected. So yeah, I got to go there and I worked
with the client for a week. It was hard, dealing with clients in general can be
hard, even though my supervisor was the one mostly doing it (poor him) I still got to
watch him closely and engage in the meetings.</p><p>After that I started my own little project, which was facial recognition on
a Google board. It was very fun and productive, I got to explore the board and
it&rsquo;s capabilities as well as implement different AI systems, work with testing,
debugging and just hardware in general. I also wrote a series of blog posts about it.</p><p>And now I actually work with compilers. Embecosm provided me, and other staff,
with a Graduate Training program where we in a period of around 2/3 months
looked at core skills for engineers, basically a very very compact version of
a Computer Science degree.</p><a href=#what-now><h2 id=what-now><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What now?</h2></a><p>Since then I joined two different projects, having the opportunity to be the
project lead for part of one of them. For the future I plan to start at Brunel
in September to study Computer Science.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://pietraferreira.github.io/quartz/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Morioh using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://pietraferreira.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/pietraferreira>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
