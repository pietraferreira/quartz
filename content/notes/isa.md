# ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
---
An instruction set architecture (ISA) is an abstract model of a computer. It is also referred to as architecture or computer architecture. 

A realisation of an ISA, such as a central processing unit (CPU), is called an implementation. 

Some ISAs are x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, or SPARC.

[[riscv|RISC-V]] is an example of an ISA and it is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use.
