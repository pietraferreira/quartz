- Automaton (plural: **automata**): a self-operating machine or a mechanical device that performs specific tasks or actions automatically, typically following a predetermined set of rules or instructions.
    - **Finite Automata (FA)**: used to recognise patterns in strings of symbols, are often represented as state diagrams and are used in lexical analysis and regular expression matching.
    - **Turing Machine**: theoretical model of computation that can simulate the logic of any computer algorithm. It consists of an infinite tape, a read/write head and a set of states.
    - **Cellular Automaton**: discrete mathematical models that consist of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of states. They evolve over discrete time steps based on simple rules.
    - **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: used in digital logic design and control systems. They have a finite number of states, transitions between states and inputs that trigger state transitions. Used to design sequential logic circuits and software control systems.
    - **Robotic Automaton**: In robotics, an automaton can refer to a robot or a robot arm that is programmed to perform specific tasks autonomously or under human control.
