# Graphviz
---
Graphiz is a package of tools supporting the DOT [graph](notes/general/graphs.md) description language.

**DOT** is a textual representation of arbitrary graphs (suffix `.dot` or preferably `.gv`).

Tools can visualise those graphs. For example `xdot`.

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz
```
