ASSESSED EXERCISE:
Using the Weighted Kappa function, WK_R.r, in blackboard, explore how the hierarchical
clustering compares to k means for the seeds dataset "seeds_dataset.csv" given the correct
clusters in "seeds_real.csv".
You need to:
• Calculate the WK for K means clustering with different values of K when compared to
the correct clustering arrangement (as found in “seeds_real.csv”).
• Also compare Hierarchical clustering results to the correct clusters with different
linkage measures: single, complete and average
• Use scatterplots to illustrate the different clustering assignments.
• Plot the dendrograms where necessary.
• Plot the different Weighted Kappa values on an appropriate graph.
