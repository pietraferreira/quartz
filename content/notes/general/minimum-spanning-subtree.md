# Minimum Spanning Subtree
---
It is a subtree with the minimum possible edge weight that connects all nodes together.

There must exist **no cycles** in the subtree.

The two most popular algorithms are [[notes/general/kruskals-algorithm|Kruskal's]] and [[notes/general/pimms-algorithm|Pimm's]].

A graph **can** have multiple minimum spanning subtrees:
