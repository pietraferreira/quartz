It maintains the insertion order of elements, however they are **not** indexed. When searching, we start with the head and work our way through.

The complexity ([big-O](notes/university/cs2004/big-o-notation.md)) of finding a value is of **O(n)**. The best and worst of insertion/deletion are **0(1)** for best and **O(n)** for worst.
