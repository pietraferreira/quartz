# Arrays
---
Simplest and most widely used data structure, which **maintains the insertion order of  elements**.

Elements are **indexed**, meaning the [big-O](notes/general/big-o-notation.md) for searching for an index is **O(1)**.

It is of fixed-size and can hold a collection of similar items.

`ArrayList` however allows for dynamic size, it is a variable length Collection class.
