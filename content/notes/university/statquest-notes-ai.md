- **Cross validation**: allows us to compare different machine learning methods and get a sense of how well they will work in practice.
- We need to **train** the machine learning method, and **test**.
    - We need to save data to test.

If we use, for example, 25% for testing and 75% for training, how do we know "which 25%" to pick? The first 25%? The middle?
- **Cross validation** uses them all, one at a time, and summarises the results at the end.
