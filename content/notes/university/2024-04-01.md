# Quick Demo Notes
---
Application [here](https://pietraferreira.github.io/fyp-rust-visualisation/).
Backend [here](https://dashboard.render.com/).

The backend is **chatgpt.js**, and you can see it running on Render (more specifically the logs).

Tests: `./run_comparison_tests.sh`, `unified...2` has more output!

## POST Request:

"A POST request is a method used in web development that sends data to a server to create/update a resource. The data sent to the server is stored in the request body of the HTTP request. POST requests are commonly used when submitting form data or uploading a file. Unlike GET requests, which append data to the URL, POST requests do not display their data in the URL, making them a more secure method for transmitting sensitive information.

In the context you've provided, where you're dealing with a code snippet related to analysing code with an AI model via OpenAI's API, a POST request is used for a specific reason. When you make a POST request to OpenAI's API (in this case, to the `chat.completions.create` endpoint), you're sending data (the `codeSnippet` and other parameters like the `model` and `response_format`) to OpenAI's servers. This data instructs the API to analyse the provided code snippet using the specified model and return the analysis results."
