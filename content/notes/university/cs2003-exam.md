# First section:
1. Familiarise yourself with Usability Engineering Principles by Don Norman. You should be able to provide a good understanding of UE principles and how they are implemented, as you will need to show this in sketch form in the exam.

Don Norman's usability engineering principles are known as the "Seven Principles of Design". These principles are:

1. Visibility: Users should be able to easily see and understand what actions are available to them. Include visual cues that make it clear which actions are available to users.
2. Feedback: Users should receive feedback when they interact with a system, so they know what has happened or what is happening. Include animations or other feedback that let users know when an action has been completed.
3. Constraints: Constraints should be put in place to prevent users from making mistakes or taking unintended actions. Limit user options to prevent unintended actions.
4. Mapping: The relationship between controls and their effects should be intuitive and easy to understand. Create intuitive mappings between controls and their effects.
5. Consistency: The system should behave in a consistent manner throughout all interactions with the user. Maintain consistency throughout the interface.
6. Affordance: The design of a control or interface element should suggest its function, making it clear how it can be used. Use design elements that suggest functionality.
7. Simplicity: The design of the system should be as simple as possible, while still being effective for the task at hand. Keep the overall design simple and easy to navigate.

You might use color coding or icons to indicate interactive elements, provide tooltips or other visual feedback when a button is clicked, limit user input options based on context, use common UI patterns like checkboxes or drop-down menus, maintain consistent button placement and labelling throughout the interface, use familiar icons for common actions like saving or printing, and avoid cluttering screens with unnecessary elements.
