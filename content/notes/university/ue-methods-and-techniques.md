# The Sketch in Interaction Design

Two requirements approaches when prototyping an interactive system:
1. Using a formal specification.
2. Developing the specification out of the prototype.

# Human-Centered Design Process: ISO 13407

Specifies general activities to be performed in development, but it does not demand or recommend particular techniques or methods.

Early in design, requirements are at a high level: design solutions are likely to be mockups.

As work progresses, higher fidelity prototypes will be evaluated against more detailed requirements.

## Why Prototype?

- Design Process: involves searching for an **acceptable** design in an infinitely large design space.

Problems (we...):
1. May not search effectively.
2. May not recognise a good design.
3. May mistakenly think a bad design is good.

The value of prototyping is "to fail, and fail fast".

## What is a prototype?

A good definition is: "building a physical working model of all, or part of the proposed system and using it to identify weaknesses in the understanding of the real requirements."

Best practice:
- Look at social and cognitive effects.
- Use hands-on testing by users, in realistic scenarios.
- Use with a design/evaluation methodology integrating prototype testing.
- Ask: what information is the prototype intended to help elicit?

## What do we use it for?

- Work out details and test them, in ways not possible at level of verbal description.
