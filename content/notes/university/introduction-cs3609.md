# Notes on FISS (Chapters 1 and 4)
---
## Chapter 1 Topics
---
This chapter covers the following topics and concepts:

• What unauthorised access and data breaches are
• What information systems security is
• What the tenets of information systems security are
• What the seven domains of an IT infrastructure are
• What the weakest link in an IT infrastructure is
• How an IT security policy framework can reduce risk
• How a data classification standard affects an IT infrastructure’s security needs

## Chapter 1 Goals
---
When you complete this chapter, you will be able to:

• Describe how unauthorised access can lead to a data breach
• Relate how availability, integrity, and confidentiality requirements affect the seven
domains of a typical IT infrastructure
• Describe the risk, threats, and vulnerabilities commonly found within the seven domains
• Identify a layered security approach throughout the seven domains
• Develop an IT security policy framework to help reduce risk from common threats and vulnerabilities
• Relate how a data classification standard affects the seven domains

## Definitions
---
- **Cyberspace**: is all the accessible users, networks, webpages, and applications working in this worldwide electronic realm.
- **SIP-enabled (Session Initiation Protocol-enabled applications)**: unified communications, e.g.: Google Chat instant messaging service.
- **Risk** is the likelihood that something bad will happen to an asset.
- **Threat** is any action that could damage an asset.
- **Business continuity plan (BCP)**: gives priorities to the functions an organisation needs to keep going.
- **Disaster recovery plan (DRP)**: defines how a business gets back on its feet after a major disaster such as a fire or hurricane.
- **Virus**: is a computer program written to cause damage to a system, an application, or data. 
- **Malicious code (malware)**: is a computer program written to cause a specific action to occur, such as erasing a hard drive.
- **Vulnerability**: is a weakness that allows a threat to be realised or to have an effect on an
asset. 

- A threat by itself does not always cause damage; there must be a vulnerability for a threat to be realised.
- Software vendors must protect themselves from the liabilities of their own vulnerabilities with an **End-User License Agreement (EULA)**.
