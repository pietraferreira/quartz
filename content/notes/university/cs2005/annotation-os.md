It provides a way to achieve mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one process can enter the critical section at a time. The algorithm is named after its creator, Gary L. Peterson.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation of Peterson's Solution:\n\n1. Shared Variables: The solution requires two shared variables: `turn` and an array of two boolean flags, `flag[2]`. Each flag represents the intention of a process to enter the critical section, and `turn` indicates whose turn it is to enter.\n\n2. Entry Protocol: Before a process enters the critical section, it sets its flag to indicate its intention to enter and assigns the turn to the other process. For example, if process P0 wants to enter, it sets `flag[0] = true` and `turn = 1` (indicating it's P1's turn).\n\n3. Checking for Conflicts: After setting its flag and turn, the process checks if the other process also wants to enter the critical section. If the other process's flag is true and it is their turn, a conflict occurs.\n\n4. Waiting or Proceeding: If there is a conflict, the process must wait until it is its turn again. It repeatedly checks the other process's turn until the conflict is resolved. Once the conflict is resolved, the process proceeds to enter the critical section.\n\n5. Critical Section: The process can now execute its critical section, accessing the shared resource without interference from the other process. It performs the required operations and completes its task.\n\n6. Exit Protocol: After exiting the critical section, the process sets its flag to false, indicating it no longer intends to enter. This allows the other process to have a chance to enter the critical section.\n\n7. Mutual Exclusion: By utilizing the flags, turn variable, and the entry and exit protocols, Peterson's Solution ensures that only one process can enter the critical section at a time. It achieves mutual exclusion by coordinating the access to the shared resource between the two processes.\n\nIt's important to note that Peterson's Solution assumes some properties of the underlying system, such as atomic read and write operations for shared variables. Additionally, it is specifically designed for two processes and may not be directly applicable in scenarios involving more than two processes.\n\nWhile Peterson's Solution was an important contribution to the field of concurrent programming, modern synchronization mechanisms, such as locks and semaphores, are generally preferred for achieving mutual exclusion in practical implementations due to their wider applicability and flexibility.","updated":"2023-05-11T19:06:37.200Z","document":{"title":"","link":[{"href":"urn:x-pdf:2d9cb7ef5a7a8c9070382769d4774a00"},{"href":"vault:/notes/documents/os.pdf"}],"documentFingerprint":"2d9cb7ef5a7a8c9070382769d4774a00"},"uri":"vault:/notes/documents/os.pdf","target":[{"source":"vault:/notes/documents/os.pdf","selector":[{"type":"TextPositionSelector","start":507669,"end":507688},{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"Peterson’s Solution","prefix":"preemptionwithin the kernel.5.3 ","suffix":"Next, we illustrate a classic so"}]}]}

Wait (P) Operation: When a process/thread wants to access a shared resource, it needs to perform a \"wait\" operation on the semaphore associated with that resource. If the semaphore value is greater than 0, indicating that there are available resources, the process/thread can proceed and decrement the semaphore value by 1. If the semaphore value is 0, indicating that all resources are currently in use, the process/thread is blocked and put into a waiting state until a resource becomes available.\n\n3.

>Summary:
>
>Bounded-Buffer Problem:
>- Producer and consumer processes share data structures: `n`, `mutex`, `empty`, `full`.
>- `n` represents the number of buffers in the pool.
>- `mutex` provides mutual exclusion for buffer pool accesses.
>- `empty` counts the number of empty buffers.
>- `full` counts the number of full buffers.
>- Producer code waits for an empty buffer, acquires mutex, adds an item to the buffer, releases mutex, and signals that a buffer is full.
>- Consumer code waits for a full buffer, acquires mutex, consumes an item from the buffer, releases mutex, and signals that a buffer is empty.
>
>Readers-Writers Problem:
>- Shared database accessed by multiple processes: readers and writers.
>- Writers need exclusive access to the database to write, while readers can read concurrently.
>- First readers-writers problem allows readers to proceed if no writers are waiting.
>- Solution includes semaphores `rw_mutex`, `mutex`, and `read_count`.
>- `rw_mutex` provides mutual exclusion for writers, and `mutex` ensures mutual exclusion for `read_count`.
>- Readers increment `read_count` and wait on `rw_mutex` if they are the first reader.
>- Readers release `rw_mutex` when exiting.
>- Writers wait on `rw_mutex`, perform writing, and release `rw_mutex`.
>
>Dining-Philosophers Problem:
>- Five philosophers sharing a circular table with chopsticks.
>- Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating.
>- Philosophers try to pick up two chopsticks to eat.
>- Solution includes semaphores `chopstick[5]` representing the chopsticks.
>- Each philosopher waits for the left and right chopsticks, eats, and then releases the chopsticks.
>- A deadlock can occur if all philosophers pick up their left chopsticks simultaneously.
>- Remedies include limiting the number of philosophers at the table, requiring both chopsticks to be available before picking them up, or using an asymmetric solution.
>

Hoare and are commonly used in concurrent programming languages to ensure mutually exclusive access to shared resources.\n\nHere are the key points about monitors:\n\n- **Encapsulation**: A monitor encapsulates shared data and the procedures (also known as methods or functions) that operate on that data. It combines the data and related procedures into a single unit, ensuring that access to the shared data is controlled.\n\n- **Mutual Exclusion**: Monitors ensure mutual exclusion by allowing only one thread or process to be active within the monitor at a given time. When a thread enters a monitor, it gains exclusive access to the shared data and can execute the monitor's procedures without interference from other threads.\n\n- **Synchronization**: Monitors provide synchronization mechanisms, typically in the form of condition variables. Condition variables allow threads to wait for certain conditions to be satisfied before proceeding. Threads can signal or broadcast on condition variables to notify waiting threads about changes in the shared data.\n\n- **Serialization of Access**: Monitors enforce the serialization of access to shared resources. When a thread enters a monitor, it gains sole access to the shared data and is guaranteed exclusive access until it exits the monitor. This ensures that only one thread is modifying the shared data at any given time, preventing race conditions and maintaining data integrity.\n\n- **Implicit Locking**: Monitors provide implicit locking of the shared data. When a thread enters a monitor, it automatically acquires the lock associated with the monitor, allowing it exclusive access to the shared data. The lock is released when the thread exits the monitor, allowing other threads to enter.\n\n- **Exception Handling**: Monitors often provide built-in exception handling mechanisms. If an exception occurs within a monitor, the monitor automatically releases the lock and exits, ensuring that other threads can continue executing.\n\nOverall, monitors provide a higher level of abstraction compared to lower-level synchronization primitives like semaphores or mutexes. They simplify the process of coordinating access to shared resources and help prevent common concurrency issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific implementation and features of monitors may vary depending on the programming language or framework being used.","updated":"2023-05-11T20:38:00.930Z","document":{"title":"","link":[{"href":"urn:x-pdf:2d9cb7ef5a7a8c9070382769d4774a00"},{"href":"vault:/notes/documents/os.pdf"}],"documentFingerprint":"2d9cb7ef5a7a8c9070382769d4774a00"},"uri":"vault:/notes/documents/os.pdf","target":[{"source":"vault:/notes/documents/os.pdf","selector":[{"type":"TextPositionSelector","start":544585,"end":544593},{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"Monitors","prefix":"e possibility of starvation.5.8 ","suffix":"Although semaphores provide a co"}]}]}
