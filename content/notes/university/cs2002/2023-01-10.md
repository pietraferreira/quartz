## CS2002 - Sequence Diagrams I (Lecture Notes)
---
When developing diagrams, we should go back and forth. For example, you might have make changes to the use case diagram when developing the class diagram and vice-versa. Normally the sequence diagram is the last one and is closely related to the class diagram.

Message is the act of calling a method which is related to another class.

The name of the use case **must** contain a verb.

All the methods used in the sequence diagram **must** exist in the class diagram.

A **trace** is the sequence of messages sent.
