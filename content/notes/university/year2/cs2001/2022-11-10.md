Quick Meeting with Sammy

13:18 to 13:45

- Registration is fully working with a database connected to it, we just don't have the other pages.
- Website fully animated with soundtrack.
- We are using **XAMPP** to manage **mySQL** and **PHP**.
- Sammy also added links to how to setup XAMPP on Discord.
- Sammy and Adriana meet yesterday (09/11) for around 2h. They worked on setting up XAMPP/mySQL and discussed the main page and registration form.
- Sammy helped me set up XAMPP and sent his files through Google Drive, he will push them to Git ASAP.
