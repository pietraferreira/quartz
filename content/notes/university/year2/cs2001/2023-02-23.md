# Forum DevLog

Today I'm working on continuing to develop the comment and reply system within the forum. 
1. Currently, the admin has to add comments and replies manually using the dashboard. 
2. The goal is to allow the user to simply type their comment and it gets displayed within the page.

- It might be a good idea to add **run scripts** to make things simpler. Same thing with installation scripts.

- Might need to review `var` names as they are not very straightforward, for example I have `aPost` to represent an object of `Post`.
