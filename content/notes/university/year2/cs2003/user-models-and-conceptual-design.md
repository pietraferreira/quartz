# Making Sense of the World
Transparent objects expose their functions, for example a bicycle.

Opaque objects however, hide their functions.

# Mental Models
Models people have of themselves, others, their environment and thing with which they interact.

It is based on **metaphors**. For example, computer as a typewriter/personal assistant/communications centre.

Mental models are formed through:
- By the self.
- Shown by others (practical demonstration).
- Told by someone else (instruction).

## Mental Models in HCI
Knowledge of users' mental models is useful in design.

Users apply them:
1. To predict future events.
2. To find causes of observed events.
3. To determine appropriate actions to cause changes.

Designing good MMs is useful in manipulating user behaviours.

## Application of Mental Models in UE
Good models **should** help you use machines.

How can MMs be used in UE/HCI?

1. Helps users develop effective models with appropriate representations in the interface.
2. Ensure users don't develop inappropriate MMs of devices.

# Conceptual Models
Term used to describe the ways systems are **designed** to be understood. It should help the user "figure it out".

A good **conceptual** model is a high level description of:
1. The proposed system in terms of a set of integrated ideas and concepts.
2. What it should do, behave and look like.
3. How it should be understood by the users, as intended.

## Implications for System Designers
1. Choose the MM you intend the user to adopt, **before** designing the user interface.
2. Exploit the system image ('look and feel') to convey the intended MM.
3. Hide aspects of the system image that conflict with the activity/conceptual model.
4. Link the choice of MM to the intended means of interaction.

## Doing Conceptual Design
Conceptual design involves:
- Structuring information space.
- Creating of alternative solutions.
- Determining which design concept to pursue.

Tools involved in conceptual design:
- Sketching, brainstorming, card sorting, flowchart, storyboards, scenarios etc.
- Personas, use cases.
