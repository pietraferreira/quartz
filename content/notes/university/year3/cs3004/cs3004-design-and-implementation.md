# Learning Outcomes
- To define the basics of client-server communication.

# Client-Server
- Client-Server programs consist of software processes that interact via messages.
- Each process is connected via program constructs (sockets) to an input/output interface in a computer called a "port".
- A **port** is a memory location shared with network software (actually more complex than this).
- Software on the other side of the port makes sure that the message you send gets there (**TCP/IP**).
- Java package `java.net` is the Java version of the **socket API**.

## Sockets
There are four possible operations that a socket can perform:
- Connect to a remote machine.
- Send data.
- Receive data.
- Close the connection.

A socket may not be connected to more than a host at a time.

A socket may not reconnect after it is closed (you have to start again).

## Connecting
- You must at least specify the remote host and port to connect to.
- The host may be specified as either a string, like `xxx.brunel.ac.uk` or as an **InetAddress** object.

# Reading
This is very general and lots of support material can be found on the web â€“ basically you are looking for socket programming in Java.
