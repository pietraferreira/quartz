# Learning Outcomes
- Make one definition of a network computing application.
- Present an example of a network computing application.
- Discuss the importance of resource sharing.
- Define seven major issues in distributed systems and network computing against your example.

# Definition
A network computing application is one in which hardware and software components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages.

The main reason for network computing is **resource sharing**.

## Consequences
- Concurrency.
- No global clock (no global anything).
- Control is distributed - how do you coordinate actions and applications?
- Independent failures.

# Examples
- Internet and Intranets (supporting role).
- The World Wide Web (supporting role?).
- Mobile applications.
- Games.
- Grid computing and Cloud computing.
- Virtual Working Environments.

# The Internet
- A collection of physical networks connected together via routers in a wide area network.
- Unique addressing (**IP**).
- Common protocol (**TCP/IP**).
- Name resolution service (**DNS**).
- Common service provision (socket-based services) to support email, the web and all sorts of services required for interoperation.
# Reading
- Coulouris: chapter 1.
