# Software Maintenance
---
- Definition: the process of **modifying** a software system or component to correct **bugs**, improve **performance** or other attributes, or adapt to a **changed environment**.

## Types of Maintenance
---
- **Adaptive** maintenance: adapting to changes in the environment, both hardware and software.
- **Corrective** maintenance: correcting errors/bugs and preventing failures, error vs bug vs failure.
- **Perfective** maintenance: making what's there "better".
- **Preventative** maintenance: "future-proofing" the code for later.

## Harsh Facts
---
- Maintenance is **expensive**, 70% software costs is due to it. For example, the US air force project cost £20 per line of code to develop, but £2,500 to maintain.
- Maintenance is **difficult**, 47% effort goes into understanding the system and identifying **dependencies**. Making changes is **risky**, because of **ripple effects** and dependencies. It can also be a low morale job.

## Factors that affect maintenance and evolution
---
1. Team stability.
2. Poor development practice (**quality**).
3. Staff skills.
4. Program age and structure.
5. The amount of "technical debt" in a system:
    1. The result of not doing maintenance when you should.
    2. That "ignored" maintenance will come back to haunt you later.
