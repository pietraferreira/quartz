# Questions
## 1. Is the Move Method refactoring generally applied to classes with a higher number of methods than other classes (methods are denoted by the Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) metric)?

Examining the `move_method` row in both datasets:
- Xerces has a `move_method` count of 1053 with a sum of WMC of 122662, which suggests it is often applied to classes with a moderate number of methods.
- Ant has a `move_method` count of 27, with a sum of WMC of 1375, indicating that it's generally applied to classes with a lower number of methods.

Therefore, in Xerces, `move_method` is applied to classes with a moderate number of methods, whereas in Ant, it is applied to classes with a lower number of methods.

## 2. Is the Move Method refactoring generally applied to classes with a higher coupling value (coupling is given by the CBO metric)?

## 3. Is the Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant refactoring generally applied to classes with a low WMC?
