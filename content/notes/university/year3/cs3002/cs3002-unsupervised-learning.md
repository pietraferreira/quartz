# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

- **Unsupervised learning**: learning without the desired output ('teacher' signals).

Some methods are:
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA).
- Association Rules/Recommender Systems.
- **[[notes/university/year3/cs3002/cs3002-unsupervised-learning-clustering|Clustering]]**: one of the widely-used unsupervised learning methods.

More distance metrics:
- Correlation.
- Minkowski.
- Mahalanobis.

They are often application dependant. The important things are the **shape**, **distance** and **scale**.
