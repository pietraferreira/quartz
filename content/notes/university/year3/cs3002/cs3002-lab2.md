Sure, I'll answer your questions based on the information provided in your notes:

**Q1)** Name one advantage and one disadvantage of using the KNN classifier:

- **Advantage:** K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) is easy to interpret, making it a suitable choice when transparency and understanding the model's decisions are important.
- **Disadvantage:** KNN does not explicitly model the data, which means it can be sensitive to noise and doesn't perform well when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or imbalanced data.

**Q2)** Given two classifiers learned from a training set and tested on unseen data to give the following two confusion matrices:

**Classifier 1:**

|     | T   | F   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T   | 12  | 8   |
| F   | 15  | 5   | 

**Classifier 2:**

|     | T   | F   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T   | 17  | 3   |
| F   | 4   | 16  | 

**a)** Which classifier is the most accurate?

To determine accuracy, we calculate the ratio of correctly classified instances to the total instances:

$Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)$

**Classifier 1 Accuracy:**
Accuracy = (12 + 5) / (12 + 8 + 15 + 5) = 17 / 40 ≈ 0.425

**Classifier 2 Accuracy:**
Accuracy = (17 + 16) / (17 + 3 + 4 + 16) = 33 / 40 ≈ 0.825

**Classifier 2 is more accurate** as it has a higher accuracy score.

**b)** Calculate the Sensitivity and Specificity of the two classifiers:

For Sensitivity (True Positive Rate) and Specificity (True Negative Rate), we use the following formulas:

**Sensitivity*** $(TPR) = TP / (TP + FN)$
**Specificity** $(TNR) = TN / (TN + FP)$

**Classifier 1:**
Sensitivity = 12 / (12 + 8) = 12 / 20 = 0.6
Specificity = 5 / (5 + 15) = 5 / 20 = 0.25

**Classifier 2:**
Sensitivity = 17 / (17 + 3) = 17 / 20 = 0.85
Specificity = 16 / (16 + 4) = 16 / 20 = 0.8

- For **Classifier 1**, Sensitivity is 0.6, and Specificity is 0.25.
- For **Classifier 2**, Sensitivity is 0.85, and Specificity is 0.8.

**Q3)** Briefly compare two classifiers stating one advantage that each has over the other:

- **Classifier 1 Advantage:** Classifier 1 has higher Specificity (True Negative Rate), making it better at correctly identifying the "F" class, which is valuable when avoiding false alarms or Type I errors is crucial.
    - Where to use it: medical diagnosis (identifying rare diseases), airport security (identifying threats) and quality control in manufacturing.

- **Classifier 2 Advantage:** Classifier 2 is more accurate and has a higher Sensitivity (True Positive Rate). This means it is better at correctly identifying the "T" class, which is essential when ensuring that actual positive cases are detected.
    - Where to use it: email spam detection (avoiding false positives), credit fraud detection and search engine ranking (filter out non-relevant or low-quality results.)
