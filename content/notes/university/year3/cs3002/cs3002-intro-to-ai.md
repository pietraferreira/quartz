# Introduction to AI
---
## Who am I?
---
- Allan Tucker, head of IDA Group (which focuses on AI models that collaborate with experts and users, more [info](http://ida-research.net/).

## AI in Popular Culture
---
- Early Computers & Turing (1940s) and the [British Bombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe) were significant milestones.
- Clockwork & [Automata](notes/general/automaton.md) (1700s-1800s) showcased early mechanical creations like Maillardet's Automaton and The Writer.
- Early AI research involved problem-solving, logic and games.
- The Perceptron model of a neuron was introduced.

### Maillardet's Automaton
---
- Created by Swiss clockmaker Henri Maillardet around the late 18th century.
- Designed to imitate a draftsman or artists, it could create drawings and write messages in beautiful calligraphy using pen and ink.
- It had a set of intricate clockwork mechanisms that allowed it to move its hand with precision.

### The Writer (1775)
---
- Created by Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker and inventor.
- Was designed to resemble a young boy holding a quill pen and paper, it could write custom messages and draw images.
- Could write any text up to 40 characters in length, even create intricate drawings.

## Turing Test (1951)
---
- It involves a conversation between a human and a machine, with the goal being to determine if the machine's response are indistinguishable from those of a human.
- Not a well defined-test, posing significant challenges in AI.

Here are some notes and explanations based on the provided lecture content:

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**

- **Who Am I?**
  - Allan Tucker is the speaker, a Reader in the Department of Computer Science, and Head of the IDA Group.
  - The IDA Group was founded in 1995 at the University of London, focusing on AI models that collaborate with experts and users.
  - They apply AI in various fields such as Environment, Health, Engineering, and Education.
  - The research is funded by numerous sources, both nationally and internationally.
  - The website for more information is [ida-research.net](http://ida-research.net).

**Introduction to AI:**

- **AI in Popular Culture:**
  - AI has been a topic of interest in popular culture.
  - It has been portrayed in various forms, from early computers and automata to more recent developments.
  - Early Computers & Turing (1940s) and the British Bombe were significant milestones.
  - Clockwork & Automata (1700s-1800s) showcased early mechanical creations like Maillardet's Automaton and The Writer.

- **Turing Test (1951):**
  - The Turing Test is a thought experiment proposed by Alan Turing.
  - It involves a conversation between a human and a machine (e.g., Eliza).
  - The goal is to determine if the machine's responses are indistinguishable from those of a human.
  - This test was not well-defined and posed significant challenges in AI.

- **Early AI Achievements:**
  - Early AI research involved problem-solving, logic, and games.
  - The "Perceptron" model of a neuron was introduced.
  - There was optimism and high expectations for AI.

- **Challenges and Realizations:**
  - Some challenges emerged:
    - Machine translation struggled with context.
    - Handwriting recognition worked well only for easy examples.
    - Chess was still dominated by humans.
  - Despite challenges, AI research led to a deeper understanding of language and laid foundations for later developments.

- **Expert Systems (1970s-Present):**
  - Since the 1970s, computers have become more powerful.
  - Deep Blue's victory in chess in 1997 was a notable achievement.
  - Research explored brain studies, algorithms, and improved models.

- **Connectionism:**
  - Connectionism, focusing on distributed processing, gained importance.
  - "Lesion Studies" showed the brain's ability to recover from damage.
  - AI demonstrated the capability to adapt, generalize, and assimilate new information.

**AI Today:**

- **AI Applications:**
  - AI is used in various fields, including pattern recognition, reasoning, sensing, responding, learning, logic, and game playing.
  - Applications span medicine, law, science, art, and many other domains.

- **Chatbots and Language Understanding:**
  - Chatbots like Lamda and Chat GPT have been developed.
  - They participate in conversations and pass the Turing Test to some extent.
  - However, their fluency relies on massive data, computing power, and probabilistic models.
  - They may struggle with understanding context and meaning.

- **AI Challenges:**
  - AI systems, like Chat GPT, can provide answers but may not comprehend context.
  - Accountability and the potential for misuse remain concerns.
  - AI is not about machines taking over the world but about addressing challenges related to groupthink, insularity, and arrogance in the AI community.

- **The Module:**
  - The lecture mentions topics covered in the AI course, including clustering, classification, neural networks, deep learning, expert systems, causal models, Bayesian networks, time series, sequence models, and AI's societal impact.

- **Labs & Assessment:**
  - Labs are part of the course, including hands-on exercises in R and Python.
  - Some labs are assessed through vivas conducted by GTA (Graduate Teaching Assistant).
  - Deadlines are specified for lab submissions and vivas.

- **Reading & Resources:**
  - The lecture encourages students to complement their learning with online tutorials, journal papers, and additional resources.

This lecture provides an overview of AI's historical development, challenges, and current state, along with insights into the course structure and assessment. It emphasizes the potential and limitations of AI technologies, especially in natural language understanding and conversation.
