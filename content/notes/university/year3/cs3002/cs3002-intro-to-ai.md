# Introduction to AI
---
## Who am I?
---
- Allan Tucker, head of IDA Group (which focuses on AI models that collaborate with experts and users, more [info](http://ida-research.net/).

## AI in Popular Culture
---
- Early Computers & Turing (1940s) and the [British Bombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe) were significant milestones.
- Clockwork & [Automata](notes/general/automaton.md) (1700s-1800s) showcased early mechanical creations like Maillardet's Automaton and The Writer.
- Early AI research involved problem-solving, logic and games.
- The Perceptron model of a neuron was introduced.

### Maillardet's Automaton
---
- Created by Swiss clockmaker Henri Maillardet around the late 18th century.
- Designed to imitate a draftsman or artists, it could create drawings and write messages in beautiful calligraphy using pen and ink.
- It had a set of intricate clockwork mechanisms that allowed it to move its hand with precision.

### The Writer (1775)
---
- Created by Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker and inventor.
- Was designed to resemble a young boy holding a quill pen and paper, it could write custom messages and draw images.
- Could write any text up to 40 characters in length, even create intricate drawings.

### Turing Test (1951)
---
- It involves a conversation between a human and a machine, with the goal being to determine if the machine's response are indistinguishable from those of a human.
- Not a well defined-test, posing significant challenges in AI.

## Challenges and Realisations
---
- Machine translation struggled with context.
- Handwriting recognition worked well only for easy examples.
- Chess was still dominated by humans.

## Expert Systems (1970s-Present)
---
- Deep Blue won in chess in 1997.
- Research explored brain studies, algorithms and improved models.
- Computers have become more powerful since the 1970s.

## Connectionism
---
- Connectionism, focusing on distributed processing, gained importance.
- "Lesion Studies" showed the brain's ability to recover from damage.
- AI demonstrated the capability to adapt, generalise and assimilate new information.

## AI Today
---
### AI Applications
---
- AI is used in various fields, including pattern recognition, reasoning, sensing, responding, learning, logic, and game playing.
- Applications span medicine, law, science, art, and many other domains.

### Chatbots and Language Understanding
---
- Chatbots like Lamda and Chat GPT have been developed.
- They participate in conversations and pass the Turing Test to some extent.
- However, their fluency relies on massive data, computing power, and probabilistic models.
- They may struggle with understanding context and meaning.

### AI Challenges
---
- AI systems, like Chat GPT, can provide answers but may not comprehend context.
- Accountability and the potential for misuse remain concerns.
- AI is not about machines taking over the world but about addressing challenges related to groupthink, insularity, and arrogance in the AI community.

## The Module
- The lecture mentions topics covered in the AI course, including clustering, classification, neural networks, deep learning, expert systems, causal models, Bayesian networks, time series, sequence models, and AI's societal impact.

### Labs & Assessment
- Labs are part of the course, including hands-on exercises in R and Python.
- Some labs are assessed through vivas conducted by GTA (Graduate Teaching Assistant).
- Deadlines are specified for lab submissions and vivas.

This lecture provides an overview of AI's historical development, challenges, and current state, along with insights into the course structure and assessment. It emphasises the potential and limitations of AI technologies, especially in natural language understanding and conversation.
