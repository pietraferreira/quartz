Relates to the [[notes/university/year3/cs3002/cs3002-unsupervised-learning|unsupervised learning]] lecture.

**Q1)** Given the following three attributes:

| ID             | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Age            | 23  | 57  | 18  | 32  | 26  | 71  | 66  | 43  | 52  | 18  |
| Blood Pressure | 95  | 150 | 85  | 110 | 100 | 80  | 100 | 105 | 95  | 90  |
| BMI            | 25  | 20  | 27  | 23  | 18  | 30  | 27  | 25  | 35  | 29    |

Choose any 2 patients and calculate:

I chose 3 and 4.

**a)** What is the Euclidean distance between each of them?

ed = $\sqrt{(32-18)^2+(110-85)^2+(23-27)^2} =$
= $\sqrt{196 + 625 + 16}$
= $\sqrt{837} = 29$

**b)** What is the Manhattan distance between each of them?

$|32 - 18| + |110 - 85| + |23-27| =$
= $14 + 25 + 4 = 43$
