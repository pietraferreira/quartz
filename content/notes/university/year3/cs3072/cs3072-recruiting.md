Hey Rust Developers!

I am conducting a research study on Rust's ownership and borrowing system for my final year project as Computer Science undergraduate and am looking for participants like you. Whether you're a Rust beginner or an experienced developer, your insights are invaluable.

My research focuses on Rust's ownership and borrowing system â€“ a key aspect of the language's power and challenge. I'm developing a visualisation tool to simplify these concepts, making Rust even more accessible for both beginners and experienced developers.

**Why Participate?**
- Contribute to improving Rust programming education.
- Gain early access to a visualisation tool designed to simplify ownership and borrowing.

**What's Involved?**
- Complete a short online form.
- Optionally try out our visualisation tool (for those who haven't used it already).
- Share your feedback on usability and effectiveness.

**How to Participate:** (link to the form)

Your input will make a significant impact! Feel free to spread the word among other Rust enthusiasts. Thank you for being part of this initiative!
