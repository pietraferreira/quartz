# Visualising Ownership and Borrowing in Rust Programming
## Invitation Paragraph
Understanding Rust's ownership and borrowing system is crucial for developers, yet it poses challenges in the learning process. We invite you to participate in our study aimed at improving this experience through the development of a visualisation tool. Your insights will help enhance the usability of Rust programming, making it more accessible for both beginners and experienced developers.

## What is the purpose of the study?
This project aims to create and evaluate a visualisation tool to simplify Rust's ownership and borrowing system, ultimately improving the learning experience for Rust developers.

## Why have I been invited to participate?
You have been selected based on your interest and experience in Rust programming, making your input valuable to the study.

## Do I have to take part?
Participation is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any point.

## What will happen to me if I take part?
Your involvement will include completing a short online form and exploring the visualisation tool. This will result in metrics to analyse the effectiveness of the tool.

## What do I have to do?
A short online form, which will be informal and will not intrude on your normal work.

## What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?
There are no anticipated disadvantages or risks, except for a minimal time commitment.

## What if something goes wrong?
The ethical guidelines and procedures put in place will ensure that there is very little that can go wrong, and if it did, it would have a minimal impact on the participant.

## Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential?
All data will be anonymised, ensuring confidentiality. 

## What will happen to the results of the research study?
The results will be published internally and, in anonymised form, shared externally.
