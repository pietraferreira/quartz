## CORE-V
We have a static relocation in `bfd/elfnn-riscv.c` (`perform_relocation`) which switches on the instruction type and encodes the instruction.

The way we were doing was we would have a `R_RISCV_RELOCID` as a case which would trigger a function, `riscv_elf_custom_relocid()` (the one similar to `add/sub`). 

`riscv_elf_custom_relocid()` lives in `bfd/elfxx-riscv.c` and it is a `bfd_reloc_status_type` function, which is the same type as `perform relocation`.

Therefore, I think it is breaking because we shouldn't call `custom_relocid()` from `perform_relocation()` as they don't exist in the same space.

```bash
../bfd/.libs/libbfd.a(elf32-riscv.o): In function `perform_relocation':
/home/pietraferreira/corev/build/binutils-gdb/bfd/elfnn-riscv.c:1653: undefined reference to `riscv_elf_custom_relocid'
```

### BFD_RELOC_RISCV_CVPCREL_UI12
- PC relative.
- Local.
- Requires a 1-bit right shift.
- Relocation number: 224
- `dst_mask`: `ENCODE_ITYPE_IMM (-1U)`

It is a 12-bit relocation for 12-bit immediates found in `cv.starti` and `cv.endi`.

- `bfd_reloc_status_type`: if this is non-null, then the supplied function is called rather than the normal function. This allows really strange relocation methods to be accommodated.

- `riscv_reloc_name_lookup` and `riscv_elf_rtype_to_howto` both **get** `howto_table` elements, so maybe I need to have something looking into the `SECONDARYhowto_table`.

### GDB
To run it:
```bash
gdb --args ~/corev/build/binutils-gdb/ld/ld-new -plugin /home/pietraferreira/corev/install/libexec/gcc/riscv32-corev-elf/12.0.0/liblto_plugin.so -plugin-opt=/home/pietraferreira/corev/install/libexec/gcc/riscv32-corev-elf/12.0.0/lto-wrapper -plugin-opt=-fresolution=test-03.o.res -plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lgcc -plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lc -plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lgloss -plugin-opt=-pass-through=-lgcc --sysroot=/home/pietraferreira/corev/install/riscv32-corev-elf -melf32lriscv -o test-03.o -L/home/pietraferreira/corev/install/lib/gcc/riscv32-corev-elf/12.0.0 -L/home/pietraferreira/corev/install/lib/gcc/riscv32-corev-elf/12.0.0/../../../../riscv32-corev-elf/lib -L/home/pietraferreira/corev/install/riscv32-corev-elf/lib test-03.o -lgcc --start-group -lc -lgloss --end-group -lgcc
```

To compile:
```bash
riscv32-corev-elf-gcc -march=rv32imc_xcorevhwlp1p0 -g test-addi.s -o test-03.o -save-temps -nostartfiles -v
```

To add missing directories to GDB:
```bash
# in GDB:
dir ~/corev/binutils-gdb/bfd/
```

To get debug information:
```
make clean
```

```
make all-ld CFLAGS='-O0 -g3'
```

## BFD
- Sections: each section contains the name of the section, the section's original address in the object file, size and alignment information, various flags, and pointers into other BFD data structures.

- Symbols: they each contain a pointer to the information for the object file which originally defined it, its name, its value and various flag bits. When a BFD back end reads in a symbol table, it relocates all symbols to make them relative to the base of the section where they were defined. 

## Sanitisers
```c
int atoi(const char *str);

int arr[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
return arr[atoi(argv[1])];
}
```

If we enable `fsanitize=address`, it runs about 3x slower but it "catches overflows".
