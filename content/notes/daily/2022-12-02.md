metabolic changes that happen, is it related to quality? first: overview of whats out there, then create focused question, which we might be able to relate back to the data we have. theres loads of info, but how can we turn it into something useful. we can do this in many ways, can do search on gene expression paper in the embryo to see whats related to metabolism, then look at some paper that look into there's of the embryo and see what basis those machines work on and see if we can marry the two sets of data. there's loads of reviews about embryo culture and what the embryo needs at different stages, related to the metabolism of the embryo, the other set of info is trying to relate that to actual gene expression and how it could match up with what people do in embryo culture. if you can come up with some genes you think are the most relevant, we can check the data and check the gene expressions 

first analysis of literature, on the library there are training courses for systematic review. have a plan on how you are going to interrogate the literature. come up with some keywords, preliminary research.

Hopefully start at next term you can tell her what you came up with, to design the question properly.

look at literature then embryos!
