| --------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| char      | Byte            | 8-bits      | 1 byte       |
| short     | Word            | 16-bits     | 2 bytes      |
| int       | Double-word     | 32-bits     | 4 bytes      |

- `.cfi_def_cfa_offset`: CFI directives are used for debugging. It allows the debugger to unwind a stack, for example: if a procedure A calls procedure B which then calls a common procedure C. Procedure C fails. You now want to know who actually called C and then you may want to know who called B.

A debugger can **unwind** this stack by using the stack pointer (`%rsp`) and register `%rbp`, however it needs to know how to find them. This is where CFI comes in:

```as
movq    %rsp, %rbp
.cfi_def_cfa_register 6
```

The last line tell it that the **Call Frame Address** is now in register 6 (`%rbp`).

To disable these, g++ needs `-fno-exceptions` along with `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables`, provided that you don't use exceptions. `-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm` may also be needed.

On Godbolt: `-g0 -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables`

Something like this:

```bash
g++ -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -fverbose-asm -Wall -Wextra foo.cpp -O3 -masm=intel -S -o- | less
```

## Useful compiler options for making asm for human consumption:
-   **Remember, your code only has to compile, not link: passing a pointer to an external function like `void ext(void*p)` is a good way to stop something from optimising away**. You only need a prototype for it, with no definition so the compiler can't inline it or make any assumptions about what it does. (Or [inline asm like `Benchmark::DoNotOptimize`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40122141/preventing-compiler-optimizations-while-benchmarking) can force a compiler to materialise a value in a register, or forget about it being a known constant, if you know GNU C inline asm syntax well enough to use constraints to understand the effect you're having on what you're requiring of the compiler.)
    
-   I'd recommend using `-O3 -Wall -Wextra -fverbose-asm -march=haswell` for looking at code. (`-fverbose-asm` can just make the source look noisy, though, when all you get are numbered temporaries as names for the operands.) When you're fiddling with the source to see how it changes the asm, you _definitely_ want compiler warnings enabled. You don't want to waste time scratching your head over the asm when the explanation is that you did something that deserves a warning in the source.
    
-   To see how the calling convention works, **you often want to look at caller and callee without inlining**.
    
    You can use `__attribute__((noipa)) foo_t foo(bar_t x) { ... }` on a definition, or compile with `gcc -O3 -fno-inline-functions -fno-inline-functions-called-once -fno-inline-small-functions` to disable inlining. (But those command line options don't disable cloning a function for constant-propagation. `noipa` = no Inter-Procedural Analysis. It's even stronger than `__attribute__((noinline,noclone))`.) See [not decay is not allowed?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50775127/from-compiler-perspective-how-is-reference-for-array-dealt-with-and-why-passi) for an example.
    
    Or if you just want to see how functions pass / receive args of different types, you could use different names but the same prototype so the compiler doesn't have a definition to inline. This works with any compiler. Without a definition, a function is just a black box to the optimiser, governed only by the calling convention / ABI.
    
-   `-ffast-math` will get many libm functions to inline, some to a single instruction (esp. with SSE4 available for `roundsd`). Some will inline with just `-fno-math-errno`, or other "safer" parts of `-ffast-math`, without the parts that allow the compiler to round differently. If you have FP code, definitely look at it with/without `-ffast-math`. If you can't safely enable any of `-ffast-math` in your regular build, maybe you'll get an idea for a safe change you can make in the source to allow the same optimisation without `-ffast-math`.
    
-   **`-O3 -fno-tree-vectorize` will optimise without auto-vectorising**, so you can get full optimisation without if you want to compare with `-O2` (which doesn't enable autovectorisation on gcc11 and earlier, but does on all clang).
    
    **`-Os` (optimise for size and speed) can be helpful** to keep the code more compact, which means less code to understand. clang's `-Oz` optimises for size even when it hurts speed, even using `push 1` / `pop rax` instead of `mov eax, 1`, so that's only interesting for [code golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/132981/tips-for-golfing-in-x86-x64-machine-code).
    
    Even `-Og` (minimal optimisation) might be what you want to look at, depending on your goals. `-O0` is full of store/reload noise, which makes it harder to follow, [unless you use `register` vars](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53366394/why-does-clang-produce-inefficient-asm-with-o0-for-this-simple-floating-point). The only upside is that each C statement compiles to a separate block of instructions, and it makes `-fverbose-asm` able to use the actual C var names.
    
-   clang unrolls loops by default, so **`-fno-unroll-loops` can be useful in complex functions**. You can get a sense of "what the compiler did" without having to wade through the unrolled loops. (gcc enables `-funroll-loops` with `-fprofile-use`, but not with `-O3`). (This is a suggestion for human-readable code, not for code that would run faster.)
    
-   **Definitely enable some level of optimisation, unless you specifically want to know what `-O0` did**. Its "predictable debug behaviour" requirement makes the compiler store/reload everything between every C statement, so you can modify C variables with a debugger and even "jump" to a different source line within the same function, and have execution continue as if you did that in the C source. `-O0` output is so noisy with stores/reloads (and so slow) not just from lack of optimisation, but [forced de-optimisation to support debugging](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53366394/why-does-clang-produce-inefficient-asm-with-o0-for-this-simple-floating-point). (also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46638527/when-will-the-trivial-code-that-has-no-effect-code-gets-removed-in-compilation/46640101#46640101).

**To get a mix of source and asm**, use [`gcc -Wa,-adhln -c -g foo.c | less`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/137479/224132) to pass extra options to `as`. (More discussion of this in [a blog post](http://www.systutorials.com/240/generate-a-mixed-source-and-assembly-listing-using-gcc/), and [another blog](https://panthema.net/2013/0124-GCC-Output-Assembler-Code/).). Note that the output of this isn't valid assembler input, because the C source is there directly, not as an assembler comment. So don't call it a `.s`. A `.lst` might make sense if you want to save it to a file.

Godbolt's color highlighting serves a similar purpose, and is great at helping you see when multiple _non-contiguous_ asm instructions come from the same source line. I haven't used that gcc listing command at all, so IDK how well it does, and how easy it is for the eye to see, in that case.

I like the high code density of godbolt's asm pane, so I don't think I'd like having source lines mixed in. At least not for simple functions. Maybe with a function that was too complex to get a handle on the overall structure of what the asm does...

---
And remember, when you want to just look at the asm, **leave out the `main()` and the compile-time constants**. You want to see the code for dealing with a function arg in a register, not for the code after constant-propagation turns it into `return 42`, or at least optimises away some stuff.

Removing `static` and/or `inline` from functions will produce a stand-alone definition for them, as well as a definition for any callers, so you can just look at that.

**Don't put your code in a function called `main()`**. gcc knows that `main` is special and assumes it will only be called once, so it marks it as "cold" and optimises it less.

---
The other thing you can do: If you did make a `main()`, you can run it and use a debugger. `stepi` (`si`) steps by instruction. See the bottom of the [x86](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/x86 "show questions tagged 'x86'") [tag wiki](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/x86/info) for instructions. But remember that code might optimise away after inlining into main with compile-time-constant args.

`__attribute__((noinline))` may help, on a function that you want to not be inlined. gcc will also make constant-propagation clones of functions, i.e. a special version with one of the args as a constant, for call-sites that know they're passing a constant. The symbol name will be `.clone.foo.constprop_1234` or something in the asm output. You can use `__attribute__((noclone))` to disable that, too.).

### For example
```csharp
// the wrong way, which people often write when they're used to creating a runnable test-case with a main() and a printf
// or worse, people will actually look at the asm for such a main()
int constants() { int a = 10, b = 20; return a * b; }
    mov     eax, 200  #,
    ret                     # compiles the same as  return 200;  not interesting

// the right way: compiler doesn't know anything about the inputs
// so we get asm like what would happen when this inlines into a bigger function.
int variables(int a, int b) { return a * b; }
    mov     eax, edi  # D.2345, a
    imul    eax, esi        # D.2345, b
    ret
```

## Objdump Tips
You can even tell `objdump` to intermix source with assembly, making it easier to figure out what source line corresponds to what instructions. Example session:

```csharp
$ cat test.cc
int foo(int arg)
{
    return arg * 42;
}

$ g++ -g -O3 -std=c++14 -c test.cc -o test.o && objdump -dS -M intel test.o

test.o:     file format elf64-x86-64


Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000000000 <_Z3fooi>:
int foo(int arg)
{
    return arg + 1;
   0:   8d 47 01                lea    eax,[rdi+0x1]
}
   3:   c3                      ret    
```

Explanation of `objdump` flags:

-   `-d` disassembles all executable sections
-   `-S` intermixes assembly with source (`-g` required while compiling with `g++`)
-   `-M intel` chooses intel syntax over ugly AT&T syntax (_optional_)
