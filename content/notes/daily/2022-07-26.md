`c.flwsp` -> zero-extended 6-bit immediate, **scaled by 4** (4^6=4096) and the boundary is half of that minus 1, thus 2047.

It seems like the boundary for not **sp** instructions, for example:

```bash
0:	7d68                	c.flw	fa0,124(a0)
```

Is **124**. And for **sp**:

```bash
2:	756e                	c.flwsp	fa0,248(sp)
```

**248**

```bash
124 = 0111 1100
248 = 1111 1000
```
