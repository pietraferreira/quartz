# Notes on Relocation Handling Prototype
---
I think I am getting this error:

```bash
../bfd/.libs/libbfd.a(elf32-riscv.o): In function `perform_relocation':
/home/pietraferreira/corev/build/binutils-gdb/bfd/elfnn-riscv.c:1653: undefined reference to `riscv_elf_custom_relocid'
```

Because `riscv_elf_custom_relocid` is being called from **inside** `perform_relocation`, thus it doesn't exist in that space. 

Also, `riscv_elf_custom_relocid` is a **status type**, thus defines the status function in the howto table.
