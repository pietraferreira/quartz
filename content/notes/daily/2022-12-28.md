Cleaned up and upgraded my nvim.

Learning how to properly set up a virtual environment: [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment).

The reason for it is because the AutoDjango script is not great.

Done some Forum work but just messed everything up, so had to restore...

## Virtual Environment Commands
---
```bash
mkvirtualenv my_django_environment
```

Using it:

- **deactivate** — Exit out of the current Python virtual environment
- **workon** — List available virtual environments
- **workon name_of_environment** — Activate the specified Python virtual environment
- **rmvirtualenv name_of_environment** — Remove the specified environment.

To install everything inside the venv:

```bash
cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 pip3 install
```
