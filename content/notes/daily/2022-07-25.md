`flw` for example is only supported by 32-bits. Therefore, there is a `fail march` test which uses `rv32i`. `rv64` doesn't support `zcf`, so should I still do the same thing? Do we put **all** XFAILs together or just the not supported insn? So for example, 64 is not supported by 32 so XFAIL (but different then unsupported insn)
