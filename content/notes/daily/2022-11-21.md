## Marine Pollution
---
Mostly comes from land sources, 80%.

Two main types: chemicals and trash.

Plastic is particularly problematic as a pollutant because it is very long-lasting.

Microplastic pollution migrates up the food chain, eventually becoming part of what humans eat.

Reduce, reuse, recycle.

Children can do activities to build their knowledge and understanding, making them more aware of the 'bigger picture' and how small actions, for example using a plastic straw, can have far reaching consequences.

"With a growing awareness of the part that they can play in creating a better future for our oceans, pupils will take a step on the journey to becoming global citizens and sustainability champions of the future"

Only around 9% of all plastic is recycled.

And remember the five Rs:  
• Rethink – what things do you really need?  
• Refuse plastic where you can – it can help make a point.  
• Reduce the amount of plastic you use.  
• Reuse items whenever you can.  
• Recycle as much as possible

Instill good environmental habits and behaviour, impart change to parents and communities.

Education can also equip young people with skills that can help them develop innovative climate solutions.
