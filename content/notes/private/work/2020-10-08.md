need mcorev-loops flag
optmisation needs to be on for it to work
nothing is on by default
gen functions -> gen starti etc
you can write gen_starti etc, they can be useful

the official documentation for the tools

for the gnu assembler -> the doc is in tecinfo like latec but much simpler ->
make doc, make pdf, make html -> look at the assembler manual as generated by
make pdf -> sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/index.html make html -> look for
anything that is target specific -> machine dependent features -> riscv
dependant features -> modify this sections -> create in gas/doc/ separate files
for target specific -> main thing as.texi -> @include c-riscv.texi -> GNU
texinfo manual -> need to install texinfo -> the directives are generally @'s,
a lot of this can be done by looking at what others did -> everytime you have
a section it will have an @ node, texinfo takes two outputs info outputs and
html/pdf etc -> need @node and @section -> there is also subsections -> chapter
is the top level, and inside there you get a menu, it has two halves first
thing is the node then the subsection -> will need a menu in so the hierarchy
works, then a subsection for corev -> or just add after -march add some words
that x_corev and x_corevhwl -> make info to make sure it generates any info
files and make html and make pdf

ld is ld.texi no doc dir
