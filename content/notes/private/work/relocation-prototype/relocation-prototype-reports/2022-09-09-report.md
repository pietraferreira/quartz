Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the work done on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype project this week.

This week I focused on making sure I am properly setup and started looking into the issue I was previously having with GDB. The issue was that currently `RELOCID` does retrieve the accompanying relocation, (for example it's type, size and masks) however it fails to retrieve the addend.

Key activities:
- Updated build scripts and improved them.
- Built the updated toolchain.
- Started to investigate previous issue.

Planned activities:
- Review project's planning sheet.
- Continue investigation.

You can find this project's reports and build scripts here: https://github.com/pietraferreira/riscv-relocation-handling (private repository)

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,  
Pietra
