a5 is t1 and a4 is t0 

it is optimising out add and move

adjust the address to the same mode, and move the des from one the regis, and then (instead of setupi using starti) push no rvc, then copy source to reg0 then back to reg1 then emit the label

it looks like you can't increment a symbol

continue to work on addi because it was working before so it should again

five_bit_sleu_operand is not working, TODO: Can also be a label?

need to take volatile out!!! in riscv.c:3251

extracted the registers from source and increment it, but it isnt in a loop so why increment? ?

we are incrementing, we need an instruction to recognise it as a loop. put a dummy line to use it after, today we want to put in a dummy loop and see if it emits it
