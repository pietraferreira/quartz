`p.extbz rD, rs1`

```
(define_insn "cv_extbz"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=r")
    (zero_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "r"))
  )]
  "TARGET_COREV_ALU"
  "cv.extbz\t%0,%1"
  [(set_attr "type" "imul")
   (set_attr "mode" "SI")]
)
```

git log for the p.clipr change from 010 to 101!

modified adduRN to add the NOTE

added empty rows as so line doesn't wrap when document gets produced 

see if Hugh has a good example program you can use

make sure to get the doc for everyone to review!!

we might be advised to put the COREV project on hold

find bugs in binutils gdb or gcc and try to fix them -> fixing upstream bugs

code speed task group have a list of 6 issues to be resolved in GCC -> might be hard

`if rs1 <= -2^(Is2-1), rD = -2^(Is2-1), else if rs1 >= 2^(Is2-1)â€“1, rD = 2^(Is2-1)-1, else rD = rs1`
