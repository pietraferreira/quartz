## Open Source SG AGM
---
Im Pietra, as mentioned previously I'm a computer Science student at brunel university and a software engineer working for Embecosm. I have been involved with open source before, mainly through the Open Hardware group when I worked on porting one of their instruction sets. Why am I here? Well I do believe that code should be transparent and available to its users and would like to to get more involved, in any way I can really, in advocating that. 

My experience is mainly with the GNU toolchain

I think i can bring a different perspective by being a student and very early in my career.
