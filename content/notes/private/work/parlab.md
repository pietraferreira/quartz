# Parallel Computing Laboratory
---
The Par Lab was a five-year project to advance parallel computing funded by Microsoft and Intel for $10M over 5 years, from 2008 to 2013. It also received funding from several other companies and the State of California. 

Prof. David Patterson was the Director.

The Chisel hardware construction language was used to design many RISC-V processors was also developed in the Par Lab.

All projects were **open source** using the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, including RISC-V and Chisel.

They never explicitly ask for RISC-V itself, their interest was in parallel processing systems.
