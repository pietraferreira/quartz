Originally with WD but now with the new company (secret).

- Code size improvements, get close to GCC - LLVM
- Overlay - can have code as overlay, goes in slow memory and you can dynamically load it to RAM. Similar to virtual memory, cache but it is a software only solution. They use ComRV (Common overlay for RISC-V).

ComRV:
- Rebase LLVM - upstream - 15 
- Rebase binutils - upstream - latest - not tested
- Rebase GDB - standard GDB would crash when we get to an overlay for example - half upstream - latest - not done

Code size:
- Apply fail save/restore patches.
- Apply LTO patch.

We can't do upstream stuff.

They want to roll forward all the work done. 

Needs to fix GCC for LLVM tests as it won't run.
