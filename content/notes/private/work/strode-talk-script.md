# Strode College Talk - Script

## What do I do?
I'm currently a software engineer at Embecosm. At Embecosm we work on the boundary of hardware, more specifically with compilers. Compiler are programs that translate one computer language into another, I'm not going to go in detail about it but for the computing students it basically translates from a high level language, like C, Python or Rust, to a low level language, like assembly. 

My work involves a lot of coding - so a lot of problem solving, time management and constant learning as things get upgraded, documentation changes and just new skills you have to pick up for different projects.

I didn't know a thing about compilers when I first applied. That was never an
issue though. So... 

## How did I get here?
I moved from Brazil in 2017 and ended up being put in a Level 2 BTEC in ICT (Information and Creative Technology) given my interest in studying Computer Science at Uni. 

After that, I did a BTEC Level 3 in IT which was again recommended to me as an aspiring Computer Science student.

Besides online courses that I took out of my own interest, those two courses were the first formal training that I had in any sort of computing.

IT was not what I really wanted to do, but my college didn't have any sort of Computer Science BTEC's so I had to get through it and just study things that really interest me on my spare time.

///me as someone that already knows what they want to study. BTEC's aren't always the best option, in my specific situation A level Maths is an entry requirement for every Uni I wanted to go. And taking A level Maths just wasn't possible with my timetable, so I ended up not meeting the requirements. So the message here is please check your requirements and please question what people think is ///

the best for you, it might not be.

I ended up finding Embecosm when I had to apply for my work experience week. They were in the college's database as a company that normally does take students from my college. 

It was only one the places I applied, I basically applied to anything computer related as I was very keen in getting some experience in the real world -- because even if I didn't enjoy the placement I would at least know what I don't enjoy doing.

I emailed Embecosm towards the end of October 2018 asking if there were any vacancies available for work experience in March. I was told that Embecosm already agreed to take one work experience student, and would only consider a second one if they have a particular passion for the field.

Thankfully, I was offered to go there and talk to Jeremy. I was extremely nervous about going as I really didn't know what to expect and was very scared that I was biting more than I could chew. So I went for the interview and was just very honest with Jeremy. 

I told him that I was still learning the basics, that I didn't really have any projects to show him beside assignments and simple programs that I wrote to help me apply what we were learning at college. However, I told him that I'm very keen to self study anything that would be helpful for the placement - something that I was kind of used to do as my course didn't really have much of a focus on computing oriented subjects as it was an IT course.

I also told him that I was (and well, am) very interested in AI (Artificial Intelligence), which I guess showed him my interest and engagement with the computing field. I walked out of Embecosm with my work placement guaranteed (yay). But, more than that, Jeremy offered me to work there part-time so I could gain knowledge and experience leading to the work experience week, something that I really wasn't expecting and was just so awesome. Yes, I did get paid for all of it. 

## How did it go?
So as I said, I really didn't have much experience. I was extremely excited though, it is not every day that you get an opportunity like that. I asked my supervisor for material to study, which gave some pointers on what skills I needed to focus on. From there I just worked on those skills using a lot of Google. 

There is a surprisingly big amount of content on learning computer science from home, there are recorded lectures, free courses and even just full curriculums for you to follow.  

My work experience project, was together with my supervisor, to implement an AI filtering system on a board for a real Embecosm client. Very cool. Again to my surprise, I was offered to fly to Sillicon Valley to work on it as the client was based there. Very unexpected. 

So yeah, I got to go there and I worked with the client for a week. It was hard, dealing with clients in general can be hard, even though my supervisor was the one mostly doing it (poor him) I still got to watch him closely and engage in the meetings. 

After that I started my own little project, which was facial recognition on a Google board. It was very fun and productive, I got to explore the board and it's capabilities as well as implement different AI systems, work with testing, debugging and just hardware in general. I also wrote a series of blog posts about it. 

And now I actually work with compilers. Embecosm provided me, and other staff, with a Graduate Training program where we in a period of around 2/3 months looked at core skills for engineers, basically a very very compact version of a Computer Science degree.

## What now?
Since then I joined two different projects, having the opportunity to be the project lead for part of one of them. For the future I plan to start at Brunel in September to study Computer Science.
